The sensitivity of &sup201;Tl for malignant tumors was 100%(22/22), but specificity was 0%(0/2). On &sup99m;Tc-MIBI scintigraphy, the sensitivity for malignant tumors was 83.3%(10/12) and specificity was 100%(3/3). &sup99m;Tc-MIBI might be more useful for the diagnosis of breast tumors, because the tumor/background ratio of &sup99m;Tc-MIBI was significantly higher than that of &sup201;Tl. In addition, &sup201;Tl scintigraphy and &sup99m;Tc-MIBI scintigrtaphy showed the same degree of accuracy (93.3%) in detecting lymph node metastasis. Moreover, when either ultrasonography (US) with &sup201;Tl or &sup99m;Tc-MIBI scintigraphy was positive for lymph node metastasis, the accuracy of detection became 94.4% The combined use of ultrasonography and scintigraphy might improve the accuracy of diagnosis of lymph node metastasis., journalTitle=Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan), date=19971225]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11441251, title=null, value=The major challenges in clinical oncological drug studies are to detect promising drug candidates early on in clinical drug development and to protect patients from adverse drug reactions of ineffective drugs. These challenges are met in the classical concept of clinical oncological drug trials in three phases. The aim of the present article is to provide a concise and comprehensive overview of the scientific logic of these 3 phases. Recent progress in the conception of clinical oncological drug studies was made in particular in phase I where the implementation of novel dose escalation procedures has led to a speeding up of phase I and an increase in the number of patients that receive an experimental drug in the therapeutic concentration range. However, the classical 3-phase concept of clinical oncological drug trials can not be transposed to trials with some novel anticancer drugs without critical reappraisal. It is therefore expected that this classical concept will undergo specific modifications in the near future. Copyright 2000 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg, journalTitle=Onkologie, date=20001001]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11441254, title=null, value=The last years were characterized by efforts on the field of urological oncology: development of highly effective regimens for the curative treatment of metastatic diseases, improvement of diagnostic techniques based on monoclonal antibodies and molecularbiological techniques, development of operative techniques to improve quality of life in tumor patients. The cisplatin-based chemotherapy led to a dramatic improvement in patients with even extended testicular cancer disease and reflect one of the major highlights in urological oncology in the last century. Based on monoclonal antibodies and molecular techniques, diagnostic approach changed for prostatic carcinoma by using prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and for testicular cancer by determining alfa fetoprotein (AFP) and beta human choreongonadotropin (beta-HCG). These marker systems are of importance for treatment decision and follow up. Other efforts were revealed in the development of operative techniques with an improvement of quality of life (urinary bladder substitution, potency sparing operative techniques) and the possibility of organ preserving treatment in renal cell carcinoma.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945280, title=null, value=The influence of the esterification of the 3'(2') hydroxyl group of tRNA on the hydrolysis by venom phosphodiesterase (Crotalus adamanteus) was studied. It was shown that this esterification does not change the rate of hydrolysis. At pH 7-8, no significant differences were observed either when the alpha amino group of the attached amino acid was free or blocked, or when the aminoacid contained a free carboxyl group or a second amino group (glutamic acid or lysine).

A zinc content of 5.0 - 7.6 g-atoms of Zn/M.W. 3.2 x 10(6) was estimated by labelling with 65Zn and by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. By continuous dialysis against o-phenanthroline zinc was almost completely removed. The enzymatically inactive "apo"-enzyme could not be reactivated by addition of Zn(2+).

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945362, title=null, value=5'-Methylammonium-5'-deoxyadenosine is a poor subsrate for adenosine desaminase. The nucleoside was crystallized from aqueous methanol as its iodide monohydrate in space group P2(1). The structure was solved from three dimensional X-ray data and refined to R = 4.1%. The structure of the nucleoside is determined by an intramolecular hydrogen bond from N5' to N3 which implies that (1) the edenine heterocycle is in syn position with respect to the sugar moiety; (2) the ribose pucker is C2'-exo, C3'-endo and (3) the conformation about the C4'-C5' bond is trans, gauche. The water of hydration is fourfold disordered and forms a linear hydrophilic region which is surrounded by nucleoside molecules in a zigzag arrangement. The adenine heterocycles are not stacked and in closer than Van der Waals distance with iodine ions suggesting a charge transfer type interaction., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700924]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945480, title=null, value=The contents of sterol derivatives (sterols + esters, glycosides and acylated glycosides) have been determined using thin layer chromatography in leaves and bulky and organs from carrots (Daucus carota L.) potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), onion (Allium cepa L.) two varieties of radish (Raphanus sativus L.) and Gentiana purpurea L. plants. Ether-soluble lipids of leaves contain 2.8-5.2%, those of storage tissue 3.1-8.9% sterol derivatives.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945497, title=null, value=Several authors have described the NBD-chloride (7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) as a fluorogenic reagent of the amino groups and the sulfhydryl groups. It reacts rapidly with the trypsin to produce a stable and highly fluorescent conjugate. The determination of the labelled residues was made with thin layer chromatographies; the lysin residues were preferentially labelled.Fluorescence depolarization measurements of the conjugate were used to determine the brownian relaxation of the enzyme. The temperature dependence of the life-time is very strong and the corrected Perrin's plot demonstrates that the relaxation time of the enzyme decreases rapidly with the temperature.The conclusion is that the NBD-chloride can be used, like the DNS-chloride but is more reactive and stable and its fixation, on trypsin can be followed by measuring the absorbance of the dye at 470 nm., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19701211]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945498, title=null, value=Tryptic hydrolysis of different arginine nitroanilides was studied. Para-nitroanilide is the most readily hydrolyzed substrate, ortho derivative is 5 times less sensitive and meta derivative is a very weak substrate. When the benzoyl group bound on the N(alpha) arginine of BAPNA is replaced by a carbobenzoxy group (L-ZAPNA), the tryptic hydrolysis is increased by a factor of 3. With this latter substrate, the kinetic constants are determined for two forms, native and Nepsilon-acetylated of porcine and bovine trypsin. Evidence is presented that the rate of hydrolysis is both related to the global and local charges of the enzyme., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19701211]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945541, title=null, value=Presqualenyl-pyrophosphate (PSPP) was synthesized from farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP). The purified product could be transformed into a squalene in 90% yield. The structure of PSPP was established by the following experiments:1) PSPP displays a remarkably acid-labile phosphate-ester bond. Analogous to FPP it was possible to stabilize this bond by the addition of bromine. This indicates a structure of the allylester type.2) On acid hydrolysis PSPP splits off not only the pyrophosphate but also water. This may be best explained by the presence of a tertiary hydroxyl group in PSPP.3) The pyrophosphate group of PSPP could be split by prostatic phosphatase. In gas-liquid-chromatography the trimethyl-silylated product gave a single peak. From the mass spectra of this compound and of the corresponding alcohol the expected molecular weight of 426 could be verified for the latter.4) Determining the 3H/(14)C ratio in 1-(3)H(2)-4(14)C-FPP and in PSPP and squalene, synthesized from it, only three 3H-atoms could be detected in PSPP and in squalene.5) Ozonisation of PSPP, synthesized from 1-(14)C-FPP, gave radioactive malondialdehyde, which was characterised as azobenzene-malondialdehyde and 4-azobenzene-1-phenyl-pyrazole. The experimental results are in agreement with the following structure of 2, 6, 10, 15, 19, 23-hexamethyl-n-tetracosa-2, 6, 11, 14, 18, 22-hexaen-10-yl-pyrophosphate for PSPP., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19701223]

After the acetate administration the radioactivity of palmitic and stearic acids and that of their carboxyl carbons was also measured. The repartition of the radioactivity was discussed in relation with the localization of fatty acid synthesis.

We used the formation of these complexes for the detection of the isoenzyme bands of carbonic anhydrase in isoelectric focusing and electrophoresis in acrylamide gels. DNSA is added to the solution of the isoenzymes before separation. Using quartz tubes - the maximum of the excitation spectrum is 280 nm [1] - for supporting the gels the fluorescent enzyme bands can be observed during development in UV light and without putting the gels out of the quartz tubes. This technique allows the detection of the carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes with greater precision and simplicity than with any staining method., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19710901]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11946256, title=null, value=The blockage of the carboxyl groups of a pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (inhibitor of Kunitz) has been performed with a water-soluble carbodiimide and glycine ethyl ester. The inhibitor has five carboxyl groups located on residues Asp(3), Glu(7), Glu(49), Asp(50) and Ala(58). When the reaction is carried out on native inhibitor or on inhibitor treated with 8 M urea, approximately 3 moles of glycine ethyl ester are introduced but 4, 3 residues can be incorporated into performic acid oxidized inhibitor. Fully active derivatives with a complete substitution of the C-terminal residue can be obtained.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11946428, title=null, value=Fatty acids of acyl steryl glycoside (acyl SG) of different plants producing both green and photosynthetically inactive tissue have been analyzed. The major components are in all cases 16:0, 18:2 and 18:3 acids. The fatty acid composition of acyl SG of green parts is very similar to that of etiolated, pale or storage tissue of the same plant. Generally the degree of saturation of acyl SG is higher than that of the corresponding total lipid. Acyl SG tends to be more saturated in green parts than in colorless tissues of the same plant. Conversely, total lipid of green tissue containing large amounts of galactolipids and 18:3 acid is much less saturated than that of photosynthetically inactive tissue. Though containing smaller amounts of 18:3, and in some cases unsaturated C(16) acids, acyl SG does not reflect the drastic increase of these acids in the total lipid of green tissue. It is concluded that fatty acids of acyl SG originate mainly from an acyl donor other than chloroplast galactolipids., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19720201]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11946635, title=null, value=The high molecular weight arylamidase-alkaline phosphatase-complex from rat kidney microsomes [1] was carefully dissociated by means of treatment with several hydrolytic enzymes or by acidification. Trypsin, chymotrypsin and pronase cause a selective solubilization of the enzymes discernible at their different electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gel. The lower migrating zone represents phosphatase, the faster migrating zone shows arylamidase activity (molecular weights 180,000 and 172,000, respectively). Incubation of the complex with papain, lipase, neuraminidase or hyaluronidase and incubation at acid conditions (pH optimum 5.0) in the absence of any enzyme also yields in the appearance of two protein bands. In contrast to the alkaline hydrolases the acid hydrolases, the pH 5-treatment and with a certain degree also the lipase liberate a second arylamidase zone lying in the phosphatese containing zone during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Treatment with SDS and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis also results in a dissociation of the complex, but only in one protein fragement (approx, molecular weight 205,000)., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19720515]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11946669, title=null, value=1. The energy-independent exchange of alkali metal cations against protons was investigated in intact and disintegrated mitochondria. The exchange is not specific for different alkali metal ions.2.

At all ions studied the maximum release of protons was 15-20 nval/mg protein.3. In disintegrated mitochondria there are no differences between the alkali metal ions (apparent K(m) 30 mM; maximum H(+)-release 50 nval/mg protein).4.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947041, title=null, value=The interaction of Actinomycin C(1) (AM) with purine nucleosides was investigated by circular dichroism. While dG and dGMP show identical interactions, rG, rGMP and 8-aza-GMP show lower tendency for complex formation. ara-G shows no complex formation. 6-Thio-GMP shows the strongest affinity for AM in accordance with previous results. Substitution on N-7 (methylation, protonation) or C-8 (8-Br-rG, 8-SH-rG) eliminate completely the complexing capacity. Another type of weaker complexes is formed by dA, dAMP and rIMP, indicated by the appearance of a positive band at 440 nm. It is concluded that in these complexes both the electron donor capacity of the purine base as well as the steric flexibility of the sugar around the glycosidic linkage determine their complexing capacity., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19690601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947135, title=null, value=The complex formed between trypsin and alpha(2)-macroglobulin retains the whole hydrolytic activity for benzoylarginine-p-nitroanilide (DL BAPNA). We have observed that the inhibition of this activity is dependent on the inhibitor used. While soya bean inhibitor (MW = 20 000) is ineffective, the basic pancreatic inhibitor (MW = 6 500) progressively inhibits the complex. In this latter case, we have observed the formation of a very weakly active ternary compound by two methods: kinetic and fluorescence polarization.Such differences suggest either that the contact site of trypsin for binding is not the same for each inhibitor or that the steric hindrance by macroglobulin prevents large inhibitors from reaching the active site. The pancreatic inhibitor can reach this site but its affinity is lower for the complex than for free trypsin., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19690701]

The results show a difference in the specificities of the two extracts. Chromatography on DEAE Sephadex suggests that the tRNA Met is methylated by the enzymes on the myeloma, while enzymes from liver react very little, if at all, with that particular tRNA species.

Plotting the log of molecular weights of several standard proteins against distance of migration or against 3 log of rate of n-dgration reveal linear relationships in ranges of 50.000 - 200.000 or 100.000 - 400.000 Daltons respectively. On this basis, a simple method for molecular weight determination of proteins (accuracy +/- 5 degrees ) has been devised. The method can also be applied for an individual protein in protein mixtures using specific staining procedures., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19691112]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947311, title=null, value=The levels of galactosyl diglycerides and the composition of fatty acids of Spirodela oligorrhiza (Lemnaceae) plants cultivated on a nutrient containing 1% glucose were studied. Controls were grown on a medium without glucose. Between the 10(th) and the 25(th) day of growth the ether-soluble lipids of glucose-stimulated plants contained less monogalactosyl diglyceride (MG) but more digalactosyl diglyceride (DG) than controls. In the same time a marked decrease of the relative amount of C(18:3) acid and an increase of that of C(18:2) and C(16:0) acids was observed. These changes of the lipid composition might be one reason for the structural changes in the chloroplast fine structure of glucose-stimulated Spirodela plants., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19691230]

Density gradient centrifugation separates catalase into two components with molecular weights of 252,000 and 316,000.

In each case, the alkaline phosphatase activity can be separated into two or three components by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and by electrophoresis. Although the properties of these enzyme fractions are very similar, there are sufficient differences to identify each species.Furthermore two of the three components separated in sheep brain differ in their Michaelis constants using beta-glycerophosphate as substrate, whereas the two pig brain components are not different in this respect. This supports the view of two alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes in sheep brain., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700216]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947462, title=null, value=In alkaline aqueous solution, the sedimentation coefficients of DeoxyHb, HbO(2) and HbCO of Lampetra fluviatilis L. are 1.9 +/- 0.1 S. This value corresponds to a molecular weight of about 17,000, i.e. the value of a single haem polypeptide chain. In weak acidic conditions, both the non-liganded DeoxyHb and the liganded forms, HbO2 and HbCO, associate to form dimers and oligomers. The monomer-oligomer transitions of these compounds take place at different pH values: DeoxyHb pHO.5 approximately 6.7; HbO(2) and HbCO pH(O.5) approximately 5.9.

Hydrolysis of the separated sugar nucleotide fraction yielded D-galactose-4-(3)H but no 3H-labelled D-glucose. This indicates the presence of TDP-4-keto-D-glucose as an intermediate in the enzymatic conversion of TDP-D-glucose to TDP-L-rhamnose. The stereospecifity of the NaB(3)H(4) reduction can only be explained if TDP-4-keto-D-glucose exists as an enzyme bound complex., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700501]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947522, title=null, value=Yeast phosphofructokinase exists in several enzymically active, interconvertible forms with molecular weights of 180,000, 370,000, 570,000 and 750,000. With disc-electrophoresis catalytically active aggregation products with molecular weights of more than one million can be detected.In alkaline media fragmentation of phosphofructokinase occurs, leading to a variety of catalytically inactive products. These seem to be oligomers of subunits with 60,000 daltons. A model of the complex subunit structure of yeast phosphofructokinase is suggested. The various catalytically active forms of the enzyme are considered as polymers of 180,000 monomers, which themselves are enzymatically active and which are composed of three 60,000 subunits., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700511]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947558, title=null, value=Guinea-pig antisera to bovine insulin and proinsulin were analysed and the association constants and the concentrations of combining sites specific for insulin and for the C-chain were determined. Both antisera contained combining sites with higher (Ak(1) sites) and lower (Ak(2) sites) affinities for the cross-reacting antigens.Antisera produced in response to both insulin and proinsulin had similar concentrations of both the more affine and less affine insulin-specific binding sites. Bovine insulin contaminated with traces of proinsulin did not induce antibodies specific for the C-chain.Antisera to proinsulin contained equal amounts of high affinity binding sites specific for the C-chain and for the insulin part of the molecule. After absorption of the insulin-specific antibodies these sera can be used for the immunoassay of proinsulin., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700601]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=16256855, title=null, value=Evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics could be better controlled if we knew how to define the potential of evolution of bacterial resistance towards a given antibiotic, prospectively. No unique method allows to do it. Pieces of answers can be obtained by using diverse methods using bacteriological, ecological pharmaco-epidemiological techniques and experimental models. Association of the results obtained with these various techniques is mandatory to understand the evolution potential of resistance towards a given antibiotic when it is used in the clinical setting., journalTitle=Medecine et maladies infectieuses, date=20050801]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=16256856, title=null, value=Exposure of populations to antibiotics is a condition for the emergence and the diffusion of bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Analysis of epidemiological causality between antibiotic exposure and expansion of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens requires the study of the basis for the emergence and the subsequent epidemic spread of the strains. Emergence of antibiotic resistance under the selective pressure of antibiotics is unavoidable. However, the rapidity of the emergence depends on several parameters including the biochemical mechanism and the genetic support of the resistance and on the couple bacteria/antibiotic considered. Several of these parameters may be studied and measured in vitro. In vivo, relationship between antibiotic exposure and risk for infection or colonisation by pneumococci resistant to beta-lactams or macrolides and methicillin-resistant staphylococci are among the best studied models. In particular for pneumococci, quantitative relationship between antibiotic consumption and resistance, including geographical correlations have been shown but do not allow to establish any causality relationship. Overall, there is no doubt on the question of the impact of antibiotic exposure and the risk of antibiotic resistance. However, the quantification of the risks remains to be accurately studied., journalTitle=Medecine et maladies infectieuses, date=20050801]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=16256857, title=null, value=Resistance is one of failure's reasons. We tried, through clinical experience, to approach the magnitude and nature of the links, between phenotypically defined acquired resistance and clinical failure, in community acquired respiratory infections. An efficient resistance mecanism, able to suppress antibiotic action, is clearely associated to a risk of clinical failure (e.g. betalactamase secretion, target modification using methilation for macrolides, target mutation for fluoroquinoles). Resistance mecanism due to reduction of target affinity (pneumococcus and betalactams) progressively decreasing beta lactam activity depending on its expression, is at present time, not clearely associeted with clinical failure. Critical concentration, defining phenotypical resistance, is predictive of failure if it identifies a bacterial population owning an efficient resistance mecanism. It will not be predictive of failure if that concentration do not detect the resistance mecanism (e.g. parC mutation and levofloxacin) or if the link between antibiotic and resistant bacteria is not binary but depends also on pharmacokinetic parameters (pneumococcus and betalactam). Using resistance as a parametre for antibiotic choice, must integrate several elements: presence or not of a resistance mecanism, type and efficiency of the mecanism, links with clinical failure and antibiotic concentration, type and site of infection. Critical concentration is not allways the magic number that predict failure or success., journalTitle=Medecine et maladies infectieuses, date=20050801]

The patient denied any history of flank pain or hematuria. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed severe right-sided ureterohydronephrosis as well as renal atrophy. The contralateral kidney was normal, as was the patient's overall renal function. A retrograde ureterogram demonstrated complete ureteral obstruction 4 cm proximal to the ureterovesical junction. Subsequent ureteroscopy revealed a polypoid mass completely occupying the ureteral lumen, of which the biopsies demonstrated inconclusive atypical urothelial changes. The patient underwent a laparoscopic nephrectomy with open dissection of the distal ureter. The patient recovered well postoperatively. Final pathology revealed a benign obstructing endometrioma without evidence of invasion from periureteral tissue. This appears to be the first reported case of asymptomatic primary ureteral endometrioma with secondary renal atrophy.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=19543453, title=null, value=Castleman disease (CD) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder and is especially rare in the retroperitoneum or perirenal area. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman in whom we found on routine physical examination a mass localized in the right abdomen without clinically important constitutional symptoms for 30 days. Abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance images and computed tomography scans revealed a solid mass localized just below the right kidney in the retroperitoneum. The patient subsequently underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Pathological examination revealed a right retroperitoneal mass of CD (hyaline vascular type). The patient completely recovered after surgery. Castleman disease is commonly misdiagnosed as malignant lymphoma, lymphadenitis or ectopic thymoma. So far, its diagnosis is mainly achieved via histopathological examination of surgically obtained tissue.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=19543461, title=null, value=INTRODUCTION: Canadian health care policy faces unprecedented pressures to reform. With new advances in health care technologies and treatments, proven difficulties in obtaining timely access to necessary health care and the realities of limited fiscal resources sinking in, the status quo is being challenged with the increased role of privately funded health care. To assess the opinions of Canadian urologists on privatization of health care in Canada, the Socioeconomic Committee of the Canadian Urological Association (CUA) surveyed all active members on their beliefs on the role and impact private health care should have in urology. METHODS: We emailed a short survey of 9 questions proposed by the CUA Socioeconomic Committee regarding private health care delivery to all active CUA members in April 2007. We received responses by email, fax or mail over a 1-month period. RESULTS: Of the 440 emails sent out, 90 surveys were returned. Respondents believed that a parallel private heath care system would shorten wait times and improve access to care (74%), improve outcomes for those with private health care (58.8%), would not impair the outcomes of those without private health care (74.2%) and would not interfere with the accessibility of health care for most Canadians (73.3%). Most respondents (91.1%) believed that, if privately delivered health care was allowed, urologists should spend a fixed amount of time providing services within the public health care system as well. CONCLUSION: This survey on Canadian urologists' beliefs on the role and impact private health care should have in urology indicated that most respondents anticipate a growing influence of private health care and advocate for a regulated fixed proportion of service dedicated to the public system., journalTitle=Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada, date=20090601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=19543463, title=null, value=INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin malignancy affecting men and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in North America. The incidence of prostate cancer increases dramatically with age. However, many health authorities advocate the cessation of routine prostate cancer testing in men older than 75 because of the belief that most patients will have a clinically insignificant cancer and will not benefit from therapy. The true prevalence of clinically significant prostate cancer in elderly men is not known. METHODS: We analyzed 1446 needle biopsies of the prostate in men aged 75 or older. All pathological reviews were conducted by the pathology department at the Methodist Hospital in Houston, Tex. Data were collected from pathology reports, hospital and clinic databases, and medical records when available. Data obtained included age at biopsy, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, number of positive core biopsies and Gleason grade. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata. Clinically significant cancer was defined by the pathological presence of Gleason grade 6 adenocarcinoma in more than 1 biopsy core or the presence of any Gleason 4 or 5 component in the biopsy. RESULTS: The median age of the patients included in the study was 78.8 and 95% of the patients were between the ages of 75 and 85. The mean serum PSA level for patients biopsied was 10.4 mug/L. Of all biopsies reviewed, 53% were positive for prostate cancer and 78% of these would be defined as clinically significant cancer. Regression analysis revealed age to be a significant (p < 0.05) factor for increased Gleason grade in positive biopsies. Logistic regression revealed age as a significant factor (p < 0.05) for clinically significant prostate cancer even when controlling for PSA. A serum PSA threshold value of 6.5 mug/L would have missed 38% of significant cancers and a threshold of 4.0 mug/L would have missed 8% of significant cancers. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of clinically significant prostate cancer in the elderly population may be higher than previously thought. As the population continues to live longer and healthier lives, it will become more common to confront prostate cancer morbidity in the eldery population. Using higher serum PSA thresholds to eliminate unnecessary biopsies in older men does not appear to help identify patients at greater risk of having clinically significant prostate cancer. Patients with prostate cancer having aggressive clinical features may benefit from treatment of their prostate cancer well into their eighth and ninth decades of life. Testing and diagnostic recommendations should reflect the potential benefit of identifying patients with aggressive prostate cancer even after age 75., journalTitle=Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada, date=20090601]

METHODS: From 2002 to 2005, 367 oncology patients banked semen. During the same period, 31 patients used banked samples in 48 treatment cycles. Samples were used for intrauterine insemination (IUI) in 28 cycles and for in vitro fertilization (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in 20 cycles. RESULTS: Pregnancy rates per cycle were 21% for IUI and 50% for IVF with or without ICSI. Overall, 16 of the 31 couples achieved a pregnancy with assisted reproductive technologies (52%).

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=19543469, title=null, value=INTRODUCTION: The endoscopic management of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) with subureteric injection (STING) has become more popular. The low morbidity associated with the STING procedure has led to some authors advocating its use as a first-line therapy. Many parents are uncomfortable with this procedure being performed in children because of the potential morbidity associated with general anesthesia. We present an alternative without added anesthetic morbidity: offering the parents a STING when their child is undergoing an anesthetic for another surgical indication. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 10 children who underwent incidental dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (DHA) injection over a 2-year period. RESULTS: We considered the treatment outcome after a single STING procedure to be successful in 8 (80%) patients and a failure in 2 (20%). Distribution of VUR grade, according to the highest grade per patient, was high in 5 (50%) patients, moderate in 3 (30%) and low in 2 (20%). We observed no complications. CONCLUSION: The idea of performing STING in children under incidental anesthetic introduces yet another possibility in the paradigm of VUR care. Though the long-term efficacy of DHA remains to be determined, this option reduces the potential morbidity of DHA as first-line therapy while favourably altering the cost benefit., journalTitle=Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada, date=20090601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=19543471, title=null, value=The development, advancement and clinical integration of robotic technology in surgery continue at a staggering pace. In no other discipline has this rapid evolution occurred to a greater degree than in urology. Although radical prostatectomy has grown to become the prototypical application for the robot, the role of the robot in renal surgery remains controversial. Herein we review the literature on robotic renal surgery. A comprehensive PubMed literature search was performed to identify all published reports relating to robotic renal surgery. All clinically related articles involving human participants were critically appraised in this review. Fifty-one clinical articles were included, encompassing robot-assisted pyeloplasty, nephrectomy, nephroureterectomy, living-donor nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy. Feasibility has been shown for each of these procedures. Robot-assisted techniques have been described for almost all renal-related procedures. However, the intersect between feasibility and necessity as it pertains to robotic renal surgery has yet to be defined. Also, the high cost of surgical robotic technology mandates critical appraisal before adoption, especially in a publicly funded health care system, such as the one present in Canada., journalTitle=Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada, date=20090601]

Yet, the relationship between impulsivity and bulimia nervosa, as well as the neurobiological substrates of these disorders, are difficult to discern. OBJECTIVES: The present manuscript reviews the neural substrates for impulsivity, including executive function, preference formation and emotional regulation, and the function of these circuits in individuals with BN. METHODS: A selective review of the literature related to the subject was performed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The discussion illustrates the complex relationship between impulsivity and BN, where impulsivity may serve as a vulnerability factor that sensitizes the subjects with BN to negative emotional states that bias the impact of environmental and internal stimuli over behavioral regulation processes, favoring maladaptive and inflexible behavioral patterns., journalTitle=Revista colombiana de psiquiatria, date=20080601]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=19936328, title=null, value=INTRODUCTION: The HIV and AIDS epidemic has quickly spread over the world with a tendency towards feminization, pauperization, and heterosexualization. Partner communication around HIV has been described as one protective factor for the acquisition of this disease, favoring the adoption of safe sexual practices, such as couple negotiation and condom use. Considering this is fundamental in the incorporation of self-care practices among female sexuality. OBJECTIVE: Determine the level of partner communication around HIV among socially disadvantaged Chilean women. METHODOLOGY: Four hundred and six (406) women responded the baseline interview for the research project "Testing and HIV/AIDS Prevention Intervention for Chilean Women" (RO1 TW 006977, PI. Cianelli). The scale Health Protective Sexual Communication Scale (HPC) was used (range between 0-10 points). A descriptive analysis was done using SPSS, version 16.0. RESULTS: The mean level of partner communication with the main partner was 3,26 +2,7 points, of 2,52 +2,48 points with the second partner, and 0 points with the third partner. The themes related with less partner communication were the condom use and getting an HIV test before having sexual intercourse. CONCLUSION: Women in the sample had low levels of partner communication in relation with HIV with all their sexual partners. Strategies within HIV/AIDS prevention programs are needed to trigger this area, in order to strengthen the adoption of self care behaviors around this issue., journalTitle=Horizonte de enfermeria, date=20080701]

Desde que se desató la epidemia del VIH/SIDA, vivir con la enfermedad ha sido señalado de manera social como una marca estigmatizante. Las manifestaciones de dicha estigmatización se han documentado entre profesionales de la salud. Este estigma puede afectar los servicios de salud que las personas que viven con VIH/SIDA reciben de estos profesionales. Los objetivos de esta investigación fueron explorar: 1) la percepción que tienen estudiantes y profesionales de la salud sobre su nivel de competencia para ofrecer servicios a personas que viven con VIH/SIDA, 2) las opiniones de éstos sobre el tipo de adiestramiento profesional recibido y la necesidad del mismo, y 3) la manifestación de actitudes estigmatizantes como indicadores de necesidad de adiestramiento profesional.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=20333258, title=null, value=HIV/AIDS stigma continues to be an obstacle for primary and secondary HIV prevention. Its consequences for the lives of people living with the disease have been well documented and continue to be of great concern for health care providers and researchers in the field. These consequences are worsened when such stigma emanates from health professionals, as this can limit access to services. One of the main obstacles for HIV/AIDS Stigma research in Puerto Rico is the absence of quantitative measures to assess HIV/AIDS stigma manifestations among health professionals. The main objective of this study was to develop and test the psychometric properties of a culturally appropriate HIV/AIDS stigma scale for Puerto Rican health care providers and to develop a reduced form of the scale suitable for use in time-limited clinical settings. The developed measure was based on qualitative evidence gathered from Puerto Rican health professionals (n=80) and administered to a sample of 421 health professionals in training.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=20396594, title=null, value=OBJECTIVE: To establish a diagnosis of the insertion of bioethics, ethics and humanistic values and attitudes to the program of the Medical School of ESCS - Escola Superior em Ciências da Saúde, public school of medicine, Distrito Federal, Brazil, in order to contribute to the process of curricular management. METHODOLOGY: The study is cohorte and documental. Thirty-two indicators to the thematic on ethics and twenty-four related to humanization were utilized. The educational purpose and contents of activities in modules such as thematic, abilities, interaction and attitude towards the community for teaching and services, from first to senior years as well as in boarding schools programs were all analyzed in the Medical School curriculum of ESCS (2006) and about the pedagogic project of the Course (2001). RESULTS: It was observed a greater insertion of thematic related to ethics and bioethics in the initial levels of the course, Freshman and Sophomore including boarded students, when compared to the insertion in Junior and Senior clerkship years (IC95%-alpha=0,034, pvalue=0,007). The unit on abilities and attitudes was the axle which presented greater recurrence of the thematic on humanization in programs of 1 and 4 years (IC95%-alpha=0,026, pvalue=0,013). It was observed an increase in the recurrence of the thematic on humanization developed in thematic modules and interaction community-teaching/service in the 2 year and decline in the subsequent ones. The results were very low in the 3 and 4 years. When compared with the clerkship it was observed that the first four series had greater insertion of such thematic (IC95%-alpha=0,042, pvalue=0,029). CONCLUSION: The academic program developed in the year of 2006 at ESCS presented improvements when compared to the pedagogical project of the course., journalTitle=Acta bioethica, date=20091101]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=21113425, title=null, value=SUMMARYIn the last decade, our understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has progressed from studies of war veterans and specific disaster victims to studies that examine the epidemiology of PTSD in the United States (USA) population. Epidemiologic data on PTSD in developing countries is an understudied area with the majority of studies were developed in the USA and other developed countries. Of the few epidemiological surveys undertaken in other countries, most of them have focused its interest on the prevalence rates of PTSD and its risk factors for following specific traumatic events. Besides increasing the international normative and descriptive data base on PTSD, an examination of prevalence rates and risk factors for PTSD in a socio-political and cultural context (that is markedly different to established market economies) can deepen our understanding of the phenomenology and determinants of PTSD. Although many psychiatric diagnoses can be related with previous traumatic experiences, PTSD has been identified as a disorder that requires a previous traumatic exposure for its diagnosis. A growing literature strongly suggests that early exposure to traumatic events disrupts crucial normal stages of childhood development and predisposes children to subsequent psychiatric sequelae. A series of epidemiological studies has demonstrated that childhood sexual abuse is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders in adulthood that includes mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, even after adjusting for possible confounds, such as family factors and parental psychopathological disorders or other childhood adversities. There is little evidence of diagnostic specificity of childhood sexual abuse, although a consistent finding has been that alcohol and drug disorders are more strongly related to childhood sexual abuse than other psychiatric disorders. Other forms of childhood traumas have been less well studied.This article reviews the findings of an epidemiological study that took place in Chile and examined prevalence rates of PTSD, traumatic events most often associated with PTSD, comorbidity of PTSD with other lifetime psychiatric disorders, gender differences in PTSD as well as trauma exposure in a representative sample of Chileans. This article also reported a comparison of prevalence rates of various psychiatric disorders among persons who reported the first trauma during their childhood, those who reported the first trauma during their adulthood, and those with no trauma history.The study was based on a household-stratified sample of people defined by the health service system to be adults (aged 15 years and older). The study was designed to represent the population of Chile. This analysis is limited to three geographically distinct provinces, chosen as being representative of the distribution of much of the population. The interviews were administered to a representative sample of 2390 persons aged 15 to over 64 years.The measures used were the DSM-III-R PTSD and antisocial personality disorder modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and modules for a range of DSM-III-R diagnoses from the Composite International Diagnostic. Traumatic events were categorized into one of 11 categories: military combat, rape, physical assault, seeing someone hurt or killed, disaster, threat, narrow escape, sudden injury/ accident, news of a sudden death or accident, other event (e.g. kidnapping, torture), or other experience. The translation into Spanish was conducted using the protocol outlined by the World Health Organization. The interviewers were all university students in their senior year studying social sciences.Taylor series linearization method was used to estimate the standard errors due to the sample design and the need for weighting. The analysis was conducted using procedures without replacement for non-respondents. The region, province, comuna, and district selected were used as the defined strata. Logistic regression with the corresponding 95% confidence interval was used to examine associations among PTSD, demographic risk factors, and trauma type. To examine whether the association between PTSD and gender could be explained by other risk factors, multivariate logistic regression analyses were also conducted.The first analysis found that the lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 4.4% (2.5% for men and 6.2% for women). Among the traumatic events, rape was most strongly associated with PTSD diagnosis. Among those exposed to traumas, women were significantly more likely to develop PTSD than men, after controlling for assaultive violence. The second analysis revealed that exposure to a lifetime trauma was associated with a higher probability of psychiatric morbidity in comparison with no trauma exposure.Traumas with childhood onset were significantly related to lifetime panic disorder, independent of number of lifetime traumas and demographic differences.This revealed that women had more probabilities than men of developing PTSD once they are exposed to trauma, independent of previous traumas, experiences of sexual assault, other violent experiences or level of education. Some authors have proposed that women have a higher vulnerability than men to develop PTSD and that there are sex differences in brain morphology, in the social interpretation of trauma, or/and in the peritraumatic dissociative experience. Although many theories have been proposed to explain this gender difference in PTSD, more research is needed to evaluate them empirically.This study highlights the importance of investigating the prevalence of PTSD, the patterns of comorbidity of PTSD, as well as gender differences of PTSD in non-English speaking countries. Although Chile has a different historical and socio-cultural context with respect to other countries in which the epidemiology of PTSD has been examined, in general, this study achieved similar results as those found in other studies.The results showed that PTSD is not an uncommon psychiatric illness, it is associated with a high degree of psychiatric comorbidity, it is more likely to predate other psychiatric disorders. Also, the results showed that men are more likely to be exposed to traumas than women, women are more likely than men to develop PTSD, and that PTSD is associated with relatively high treatment utilization.However, compared to another country in Latin America, such as Mexico, Chile has a lower prevalence of PTSD and trauma exposure, which may due to socio-economic factors, such as less inequity between the wealthy and the poor and less violence, crime, and poverty in Chile than Mexico. These studies also suggest that traumatic events that occur in childhood are related to specific disorders rather than those that occurred later in life.Individuals with childhood interpersonal trauma exposure are more likely to suffer from lifetime panic disorder, agoraphobia or PTSD compared to those who experience interpersonal trauma as an adult. However, research should examine the specificity of these disorders in relation to various types of childhood traumas.Limitations of the current study include the use of lay interviewers who, despite acceptable levels of reliability and validity, may be less accurate than clinicians as interviewers.Also the retrospective recall of lifetime disorders is likely to be less accurate than a more recent time frame. The sample used in this study does not show nation wide perspective, because the Southern portion of the country which includes much of the indigenous population was excluded. This study, like most epidemiological studies, did not use an-depth or validated index of trauma, which may have diluted findings. Since this study was cross-sectional, a direct cause-effect relationship cannot be assumed between trauma exposure and subsequent disorders., journalTitle=Salud mental (Mexico City, Mexico), date=20090101]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=21132048, title=null, value=OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection characterized by a change in the micro flora of the vagina. BV has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased risk of acquisitions of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). In this study, we sought to determine the association of douching and other behavioral risk factors in relation to BV.  METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out among 1252 women attending four family planning clinics in Lima, Peru in 1997. Structured questionnaire was used to collect information on socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics of women. BV was diagnosed by the Nugent's score. Logistic regression procedures were employed to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).  RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 25.1 ± 4.7 and 23.4% had more than 11 years of formal education. The prevalence of BV was 20.1% and significantly associated with a number of behavioral risk factors. Women who practice douching were 2.28-times (OR=2.28; 95% CI: 1.0-5.0) more likely to have BV compared with those who didn't practice. Having two or more sexual partners was also associated with a two folds (OR=2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.5) increased risk of BV. Those who started sexual intercourse at a younger age were 1.4-times (OR=1.0-1.9) more likely to have BV.  CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: Douching is a risk factors associated with BV among Peruvian women. Programs aimed at women's health must address the adverse health outcomes associated with douching. Future population based studies that investigate associations of douching and adverse reproductive and gynecologic health outcomes need to be conducted., journalTitle=Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica, date=20090101]

When the use of substances is added to this, the vulnerability of this group in terms of HIV is magnified. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of substances in socially disadvantaged women and to identify HIV/AIDS risk factors associated with the use or consumption of substances. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 52 women were interviewed as part of the project "Testing an HIV prevention intervention in Chilean women" GRANT # RO1 TW 006977. Socio-demographic and substance use variables are described through descriptive statistics, and the relationship between variables is analyzed using correlation tests. RESULTS: The results reveal a socio-demographic profile that places women in a vulnerable situation regarding transmission of HIV/AIDS, with high indices of substance use amplifying risk. CONCLUSIONS: These finding indicate the need for interventions focusing on HIV prevention in women that incorporate the risks associated with the consumption of substances., journalTitle=Horizonte de enfermeria, date=20060101]

Alguns autores, contudo, chamam atenção para questões importantes na calibragem dos modelos finais que utilizam o programa GoM versão 3.4, como o problema de identificabilidade - soluções múltiplas para parâmetros estimados. Neste artigo, é sugerido um procedimento capaz de identificar um modelo final com solução única que descreva os tipos puros mais fidedignos à base de dados, em uma tentativa de otimização. Para ilustrar esse processo, utilizou-se uma base de dados correspondente a um levantamento econômico e sociodemográfico de uma população de pequenos agricultores residentes ao longo da Rodovia Transamazônica, no Estado do Pará. Também identificou-se a existência de instabilidade nos parâmetros estimados pelo programa GoM 3.4, sendo proposto um método de estabilização de seus valores. Com esses procedimentos combinados, os usuários do programa GoM 3.4 poderão descrever sua base de dados de forma mais adequada e responder às críticas sobre questões de identificabilidade e estabilidade dos modelos resultantes.

RESULTADOS: En todos los casos se comprobó la presencia de metaplasia intestinal incompleta. Las células columnares dentro del epitelio metaplásico contenían mucinas neutras. A mayor severidad de la lesión se encontró significativamente menor expresión de sialomucinas en las células columnares (p de tendencia igual a 0,03). En sujetos con lesiones indefinidas para displasia se observó un mayor contenido de sulfomucinas en las células caliciformes (p=0,034) y de MUC2 en las células columnares (p=0,029) que en sujetos con esófago de Barrett sin displasia. Se observó expresión de la mucina intestinal MUC2 y de la mucina gástrica MUC5AC en todas las muestras. MUC6, una mucina de las glándulas profundas gástricas, se presentó ocasionalmente. CONCLUSI#ENTITYSTARTX000F3;N: La evaluación de los perfiles de mucinas en el esófago de Barrett sugiere una transición gradual del fenotipo del epitelio metaplásico a medida que la lesión avanza en el tiempo., journalTitle=Revista espanola de patologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Anatomia Patologica y de la Sociedad Espanola de Citologia, date=20100101]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22025907, title=null, value=Las profesiones de la salud tienen un papel social dual. Por un lado, velan por el mantenimiento de la salud de la población protegiendo el bien común. Por el otro, dictaminan las formas saludables, y por lo tanto socialmente apropiadas, de ser, actuar y pensar. Este último papel, está más ligado al control social de la población que a una preocupación altruista hacia la misma. A través de esta supervisión y control, se construyen los sujetos a los cuales todos/as debemos aspirar a ser para gozar de aceptación social. Los/as profesionales de la salud han jugado un rol protagónico en dicho proceso, siendo los agentes que delimitan y definen lo que es enfermo vs. saludable, útil vs. inútil, apropiado vs. inapropiado. En el caso de la epidemia del VIH, este esfuerzo se ha hecho cada vez más vigente ya que estos/as profesionales juegan un papel importante en el tratamiento de las personas que viven con VIH/SIDA (PVVS). Sin embargo, su función está plasmada de definiciones que sirven para criminalizar a las PVVS. El objetivo de este estudio fue explorar la manera en que una muestra de profesionales de la salud en Puerto Rico construyen a las PVVS. Con este propósito, entrevistamos 80 profesionales de la salud y estudiantes de estas profesiones. Estas entrevistas fueron grabadas, transcritas y sometidas a un análisis de discurso. Los resultados reflejaron que según las personas participantes: 1) la PVVS no es una persona "normal" o funcional bajo los estándares sociales debido a que su salud no se los permite, 2) representa una carga para la sociedad incluyendo familiares, amigos/as, el mundo del trabajo, e incluso para el gobierno, 3) debe ser vigilada porque representa un riesgo para la persona seronegativa que es descrita como saludable y productiva, y 4) necesita que su salud y conducta sexual sean controladas por vía legal y/o por las personas que representan las instituciones sociales, como lo son los/as profesionales de la salud. En este artículo abordamos el potencial rol de la psicología para servir como vehículo de reconstrucción de dichas nociones, tomando en consideración su propio rol en la formación y mantenimiento de dicho sujeto socialmente deseable., journalTitle=Ciencias de la conducta : revista del Centro Caribeno de Estudios Post-Graduados, date=20060101]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22319221, title=null, value=A multidisciplinary study was performed on a c. 30 m thick, limnic-deltaic sequence in the Styrian Basin (Austria). Geophysical (gamma ray activity, rock magnetism), geochemical (organic carbon, sulphur) and sedimentological observations were combined with palaeontological information (mainly ostracods). On this base, several ecological factors were deduced (terrigenous influx, salinity, water depth and oxygenation). Based on integrated stratigraphy as well as on palaeomagnetic results the whole section is set to Chron C5r.2r-1n (11.308-11.263 Ma) and covers a period of less than 45 kyr. In addition to the long-term record, we analysed short-term changes by high-resolution sampling (5 mm sample interval; ostracods, magnetic susceptibility). This ~ 2.3 m-thick interval spans in total < 3500 yr with an individual sample resolution of a few years only. The combination of these data permit the description of the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the section in detail: at the base of the section, the development of a conifer swamp on the lakeside of Lake Pannon is documented. This almost freshwater swamp existed for some centuries before it became extinct within a few decades due to a rise of the water-table. The drowning is related to a transgression of Lake Pannon, which triggered the establishment of a brackish-water fauna as well as greigite formation in the lake sediments. In general, the ongoing transgression favoured benthic life due to increased salinity (up to mesohaline conditions). The high-resolution ostracod and magnetic susceptibility record reflect short-term fluctuations in bottom-water ventilation. These oscillations probably range in the order of centuries and decades and are possibly related to climatic shifts. Later, the successive deepening of the lake resulted in a significant faunal turnover. A meromictic system with a well-established, oxygen-depleted hypolimnion developed. Finally, the limnic phase was replaced by a prograding deltaic system, where the amplified input of coarse-grained material and freshwater also affected benthic life. Periodic changes in clay (illite) content were detected by the gamma ray-log throughout the entire section. The observed cycles (5-12 kyr) of the gamma ray-log may reflect a super-ordinate modulation of the sedimentary record by climatically forced changes in precipitation or run-off., journalTitle=Palaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology, date=20111201]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22319223, title=null, value=Protective coatings for high temperature applications, as present e.g. during cutting and milling operations, require excellent mechanical and thermal properties during work load. The Ti(1 - x)Al(x)N system is industrially well acknowledged as it covers some of these requirements, and even exhibits increasing hardness with increasing temperature in its cubic modification, known as age hardening. The thermally activated diffusion at high temperatures however enables for the formation of wurtzite AlN, which causes a rapid reduction of mechanical properties in Ti(1 - x)Al(x)N coatings. The present work investigates the possibility to increase the formation temperature of w-AlN due to Hf alloying up to 10 at.% at the metal sublattice of Ti(1 - x)Al(x)N films. Ab initio predictions on the phase stability and decomposition products of quaternary Ti(1 - x - y)Al(x)Hf(y)N alloys, as well as the ternary Ti(1 - x)Al(x)N, Hf(1 - x)Al(x)N and Ti(1 - z)Hf(z)N systems, facilitate the interpretation of the experimental findings. Vacuum annealing treatments from 600 to 1100 °C indicate that the isostructural decomposition, which is responsible for age hardening, of the Ti(1 - x - y)Al(x)Hf(y)N films starts at lower temperatures than the ternary Ti(1 - x)Al(x)N coating. However, the formation of a dual phase structure of c-Ti(1 - z)Hf(z)N (with z = y/(1 - x)) and w-AlN is shifted to ~ 200 °C higher temperatures, thus retaining a film hardness of ~ 40 GPa up to ~ 1100 °C, while the Hf free films reach the respective hardness maximum of ~ 38 GPa already at ~ 900 °C. Additional annealing experiments at 850 and 950 °C for 20 h indicate a substantial improvement of the oxidation resistance with increasing amount of Hf in Ti(1 - x - y)Al(x)Hf(y)N., journalTitle=Surface & coatings technology, date=20120125]

This paper addresses the structure and phase stability of group IVB TM-Al-N systems Ti(1-x)Al(x)N, Zr(1-x)Al(x)N, and Hf(1-x)Al(x)N. The predicted stability regions of the rock salt cubic structures are x ? 0.7, x ? 0.45, and x ? 0.45, respectively, while the wurtzite-type single phase field is obtained for x ? 0.7, x ? 0.68, and x ? 0.62 respectively. The predicted phase stability regions and the broad dual-phase transition regions in the case of Zr(1-x)Al(x)N and Hf(1-x)Al(x)N are validated by experiments. Furthermore, the phase transition from cubic to wurtzite with increasing Al content in the alloys is correlated with changes of electronic structure and bonding in the systems., journalTitle=Surface & coatings technology, date=20111225]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22345828, title=null, value=Although the residual method, or constrained regularization, is frequently used in applications, a detailed study of its properties is still missing. This sharply contrasts the progress of the theory of Tikhonov regularization, where a series of new results for regularization in Banach spaces has been published in the recent years. The present paper intends to bridge the gap between the existing theories as far as possible. We develop a stability and convergence theory for the residual method in general topological spaces. In addition, we prove convergence rates in terms of (generalized) Bregman distances, which can also be applied to non-convex regularization functionals.We provide three examples that show the applicability of our theory. The first example is the regularized solution of linear operator equations on L(p)-spaces, where we show that the results of Tikhonov regularization generalize unchanged to the residual method. As a second example, we consider the problem of density estimation from a finite number of sampling points, using the Wasserstein distance as a fidelity term and an entropy measure as regularization term. It is shown that the densities obtained in this way depend continuously on the location of the sampled points and that the underlying density can be recovered as the number of sampling points tends to infinity. Finally, we apply our theory to compressed sensing. Here, we show the well-posedness of the method and derive convergence rates both for convex and non-convex regularization under rather weak conditions., journalTitle=Applied mathematics and computation, date=20111115]

In this study, a CO(2) diffusion technique was used to crystallize inorganic calcite from aqueous solutions at different ionic strength/salinity by the addition of NaCl at 25 °C. Results show that the discrimination of Sr(2+) versus Ca(2+) during calcite formation is mainly controlled by precipitation rate (R in ?mol/m(2)/h) and is weakly influenced by ionic strength/salinity. In analogy to Sr incorporation, (44)Ca/(40)Ca fractionation during precipitation of calcite is weakly influenced by ionic strength/salinity too. At 25 °C the calcium isotope fractionation between calcite and aqueous calcium ions (?(44/40)Ca(calcite-aq) = ?(44/40)Ca(calcite) - ?(44/40)Ca(aq)) correlates inversely to log R values for all experiments. In addition, an inverse relationship between ?(44/40)Ca(calcite-aq) and log D(Sr), which is independent of temperature, precipitation rate, and aqueous (Sr/Ca)(aq) ratio, is not affected by ionic strength/salinity either. Considering the log D(Sr) and ?(44/40)Ca(calcite-aq) relationship, Sr/Ca and ?(44/40)Ca(calcite) values of precipitated calcite can be used as an excellent multi-proxy approach to reconstruct environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation rate) of calcite growth and diagenetic alteration., journalTitle=Geochimica et cosmochimica acta, date=20120115]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22347723, title=null, value=The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability gained scientific attention after observations at Venus by the spacecraft Pioneer Venus Orbiter gave rise to speculations that the instability contributes to the loss of planetary ions through the formation of plasma clouds. Since then, a handful of studies were devoted to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the ionopause and its implications for Venus. The aim of this study is to investigate the stability of the two instability-relevant boundary layers around Venus: the induced magnetopause and the ionopause. We solve the 2D magnetohydrodynamic equations with the total variation diminishing Lax-Friedrichs algorithm and perform simulation runs with different initial conditions representing the situation at the boundary layers around Venus. Our results show that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability does not seem to be able to reach its nonlinear vortex phase at the ionopause due to the very effective stabilizing effect of a large density jump across this boundary layer. This seems also to be true for the induced magnetopause for low solar activity. During high solar activity, however, there could occur conditions at the induced magnetopause which are in favour of the nonlinear evolution of the instability. For this situation, we estimated roughly a growth rate for planetary oxygen ions of about 7.6 × 10(25) s(-1), which should be regarded as an upper limit for loss due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability., journalTitle=Icarus, date=20111201]

Thus in the first part, an analysis approach, developed for evolution strategies, was applied to simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation on the noisy sphere model. A considerable advantage of this approach is that convergence results for non-noisy and noisy optimization can be obtained simultaneously. Next to the convergence rates, optimal step sizes and convergence criteria for 3 different noise models were derived. These results were validated by simulation experiments. Afterward, the results were used for a comparison with evolution strategies on the sphere model in combination with the 3 noise models. It was shown that both strategies perform similarly, with a slight advantage for SPSA if optimal settings are used and the noise strength is not too large., journalTitle=Theoretical computer science, date=20120217]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22474397, title=null, value=Linear kinetic Monte Carlo particle transport models are frequently employed in fusion plasma simulations to quantify atomic and surface effects on the main plasma flow dynamics. Separate codes are used for transport of neutral particles (incl. radiation) and charged particles (trace impurity ions). Integration of both modules into main plasma fluid solvers provides then self-consistent solutions, in principle. The required interfaces are far from trivial, because rapid atomic processes in particular in the edge region of fusion plasmas require either smoothing and resampling, or frequent transfer of particles from one into the other Monte Carlo code. We propose a different scheme here, in which despite the inherently different mathematical form of kinetic equations for ions and neutrals (e.g. Fokker-Planck vs. Boltzmann collision integrals) both types of particle orbits can be integrated into one single code. We show that the approximations and shortcomings of this "single sourcing" concept (e.g., restriction to explicit ion drift orbit integration) can be fully tolerable in a wide range of typical fusion edge plasma conditions, and be overcompensated by the code-system simplicity, as well as by inherently ensured consistency in geometry (one single numerical grid only) and (the common) atomic and surface process modules., journalTitle=Computer physics communications, date=20120401]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22485060, title=null, value=We introduce an object-based method to automatically classify topography from SRTM data. The new method relies on the concept of decomposing land-surface complexity into more homogeneous domains. An elevation layer is automatically segmented and classified at three scale levels that represent domains of complexity by using self-adaptive, data-driven techniques. For each domain, scales in the data are detected with the help of local variance and segmentation is performed at these appropriate scales. Objects resulting from segmentation are partitioned into sub-domains based on thresholds given by the mean values of elevation and standard deviation of elevation respectively. Results resemble reasonably patterns of existing global and regional classifications, displaying a level of detail close to manually drawn maps. Statistical evaluation indicates that most of classes satisfy the regionalization requirements of maximizing internal homogeneity while minimizing external homogeneity. Most objects have boundaries matching natural discontinuities at regional level. The method is simple and fully automated. The input data consist of only one layer, which does not need any pre-processing. Both segmentation and classification rely on only two parameters: elevation and standard deviation of elevation. The methodology is implemented as a customized process for the eCognition® software, available as online download. The results are embedded in a web application with functionalities of visualization and download., journalTitle=Geomorphology (Amsterdam, Netherlands), date=20120301]

The generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) in the frame of density functional theory (DFT) approach has been adopted. It is found that the transition from wurtzite (B4) to rocksalt (B1) phase occurs at a pressure of approximately 12.7 GPa. In addition, a change from a direct to an indirect band gap is observed. The mechanism of these changes is discussed. The phonon frequencies and densities of states (DOS) are derived using the linear response approach and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). The properties of phonons are described by the harmonic approximation method.

The corresponding reactions with H(2)S and CH(3)SH are also investigated using the G3B3 and CBS-QB3 methods in order to demonstrate the accuracy of BB1K functional in finding activation barriers for hydrogen atom transfer reactions. Arrhenius parameters for the title reactions are fitted in the temperature range of 300 K-2000 K. The calculated reaction enthalpies are in good agreement with their corresponding experimental reaction enthalpies. It is found that H abstraction by OH radicals from the thiophenol molecule proceed in a much slower rate in reference to the analogous phenol molecule. [Formula: see text] of thiophenoxy radical is calculated to be 63.3 kcal/mol. Kinetic parameters presented herein should be useful in describing the decomposition rate of thiophenol; i.e., one of the major aromatic sulfur carriers, at high temperatures., journalTitle=Computational & theoretical chemistry, date=20110901]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22505769, title=null, value=In cooperatively breeding animals, in which nonbreeding subordinates assist in rearing offspring born to dominants, breeders and helpers may be in conflict over their respective contributions to offspring care and selection may favour breeders that use aggression to elevate the work rates of helpers. We tested the prediction that dominant female meerkats, Suricata suricatta, should increase aggression towards subordinates when the need for help is higher, by playing back recordings of pup begging calls to simulate increased need for help. Second, we tested the prediction that dominants should reduce aggression when subordinates help more, by playing back recordings of feeding calls to simulate elevated pup provisioning rates by subordinates. Neither of the two playback experiments affected rates of aggressive interactions between breeding females and helpers. Instead, breeding females increased their own level of pup provisioning in response to increased pup begging. Hence, our results do not support a role of aggression in regulating helping behaviour in meerkats, but suggest that pup provisioning can be explained by direct and/or indirect benefits derived from helping. As yet, firm evidence that breeders use aggression to promote helping by subordinates in cooperative animal societies remains elusive., journalTitle=Animal behaviour, date=20120301]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22505770, title=null, value=We study the distribution of triples of codewords of codes and ordered codes. Schrijver [A. Schrijver, New code upper bounds from the Terwilliger algebra and semidefinite programming, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 51 (8) (2005) 2859-2866] used the triple distribution of a code to establish a bound on the number of codewords based on semidefinite programming. In the first part of this work, we generalize this approach for ordered codes. In the second part, we consider linear codes and linear ordered codes and present a MacWilliams-type identity for the triple distribution of their dual code. Based on the non-negativity of this linear transform, we establish a linear programming bound and conclude with a table of parameters for which this bound yields better results than the standard linear programming bound., journalTitle=Discrete mathematics, date=20111028]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22505792, title=null, value=Although nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) favors a sparse and part-based representation of nonnegative data, there is no guarantee for this behavior. Several authors proposed NMF methods which enforce sparseness by constraining or penalizing the [Formula: see text] of the factor matrices. On the other hand, little work has been done using a more natural sparseness measure, the [Formula: see text]. In this paper, we propose a framework for approximate NMF which constrains the [Formula: see text] of the basis matrix, or the coefficient matrix, respectively. For this purpose, techniques for unconstrained NMF can be easily incorporated, such as multiplicative update rules, or the alternating nonnegative least-squares scheme. In experiments we demonstrate the benefits of our methods, which compare to, or outperform existing approaches., journalTitle=Neurocomputing, date=20120315]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22536004, title=null, value=Social competence is defined as the ability of an animal to optimize the expression of social behaviour as a function of the available social information. The social environment encountered early in life can affect the expression of various social behaviours later in life. We investigated whether early social experience can affect social competence. In the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, we tested whether individuals reared with older brood-caring conspecifics persistently perform better in a series of tasks (1) simulating different social contexts, (2) assigning individuals different social roles and (3) exposing them to an unknown social situation. Fish that had been reared together with older conspecifics showed more appropriate behaviours both as winners (more aggressive displays) and as losers (more submissive displays) when aggressively competing with peers over a resource, and when trying to be accepted as subordinate group member and prospective brood care helper by an unfamiliar dominant pair (more submissive displays near shelters), a situation they had never encountered before. In both tasks fish that had grown up with older fish were tolerated better by conspecifics than fish reared with same-age siblings only. We detected effects of the early environment on social behaviour in the juvenile and adult stages of the test fish. Our results suggest that growing up in more complex social groups fosters a general social ability (i.e. social competence) in N. pulcher that improves their performance across different social roles and contexts, and which may provide fitness benefits., journalTitle=Animal behaviour, date=20120401]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22544984, title=null, value=The chemical pesticide, imidacloprid (IMI) has long-lasting effectiveness against Hemiptera. IMI is commonly used to control the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). Some chemical pesticides, however, can induce the susceptibility of rice to BPH, which has indirectly led to the resurgence of BPH. The mechanism of the chemical induction of the susceptibility of rice to BPH was not previously understood. Here, a 44 K Agilent Rice Expression Microarray was used to identify changes in gene expression that accompany IMI-induced rice susceptibility to BPH. The results showed that 225 genes were differentially expressed, of which 117 were upregulated, and 108 were downregulated. Gene ontology annotation and pathway analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were mainly classified into the eight functional groups: oxidation reduction, regulation of cellular process, response to stress, electron carrier activity, metabolic process, transport, signal transducer, and organismal development. The genes encoding plant lipid transfer protein, lignin peroxidase, and flavonol-3-O-methyltransferenase may be important responses to the IMI-induced susceptibility of rice to BPH. The reliability of the microarray data was verified by performing quantitative real-time PCR and the data provide valuable information for further study of the molecular mechanism of IMI-induced susceptibility of rice., journalTitle=Pesticide biochemistry and physiology, date=20120301]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22556453, title=null, value=Classifier grids have shown to be a considerable choice for object detection from static cameras. By applying a single classifier per image location the classifier's complexity can be reduced and more specific and thus more accurate classifiers can be estimated. In addition, by using an on-line learner a highly adaptive but stable detection system can be obtained. Even though long-term stability has been demonstrated such systems still suffer from short-term drifting if an object is not moving over a long period of time. The goal of this work is to overcome this problem and thus to increase the recall while preserving the accuracy. In particular, we adapt ideas from multiple instance learning (MIL) for on-line boosting. In contrast to standard MIL approaches, which assume an ambiguity on the positive samples, we apply this concept to the negative samples: inverse multiple instance learning. By introducing temporal bags consisting of background images operating on different time scales, we can ensure that each bag contains at least one sample having a negative label, providing the theoretical requirements. The experimental results demonstrate superior classification results in presence of non-moving objects., journalTitle=Pattern recognition letters, date=20120501]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=22577484, title=null, value=Two methods (Scheme A and Scheme B) were developed to optimize the relative weights on quantitative trait loci (QTL) and contributions of selected individuals simultaneously to maximize selection response while constraining the rate of inbreeding to the rate observed in gene assisted selection (GAS). In Scheme A, both the relative weights give to QTL and contributions of the selected individuals were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The possible solutions for relative weights of QTL and contributions of the selected individuals were encoded simultaneously. A physical selection population was used to evaluate the fitness of each encoded solution using stochastic simulation with 50 replicates. The fitness of each solution was the mean of all replicates for accumulative discounted sum of genetic means of all generations in physical selection population. In Scheme B, the optimization for relative weights on QTL was similar to Scheme A, and also was implemented based on a genetic algorithm. However, unlike Scheme A, an optimal contribution algorithm (OC) was used to optimize contributions of selection candidates. When compared with GAS, Schemes A and B resulted in up to 15.88 and 22.26% extra discounted sum of genetic value of all generations in a long planning horizon, respectively. Compared GAS+OC and Scheme B, most of the increase (about 78%) in genetic gain was produced by only optimizing contributions of selected individuals. The optimization for relative weight given to QTL just avoided the long-term loss (about 22%) observed in GAS scheme., journalTitle=Livestock science, date=20111101]

It is assumed that the charge density satisfies Wiener condition which is a version of Fermi Golden Rule, and that the momenta of the charge distribution vanish up to the fourth order.

There are indications that appliance of structural pain assessment can contribute to the adequate diagnosis of pain. The aim of this study is to gain insight into applied interventions after diagnosing pain with an observational pain scale (PACSLAC-D) among nursing home resident with dementia.During a six week period pain was measured twice a week, among 22 residents of a psychogeriatric nursing home ward, using the PACSLAC-D. Interventions undertaken as a result of a pain score were inventoried on a datasheet. After the third and sixth week implementation of pain assessment was evaluated.In total 264 pain assessments using the PACSLAC-D were conducted. Of all scheduled standardized measurements 90% was completed. Sixty observations resulted in a pain score. Completed datasheets (N=39) showed that a pain score often (N=17) did not result in any intervention. The majority of interventions that were undertaken consisted of a non pharmacological approach (N=19). Evaluation meetings indicated that the PACSLAC-D was considered useful, though the chosen procedure of standardized measurements twice a week was not yet ideal.This study demonstrates that although there was a high compliance rate, pain relieving interventions were not frequently applied.Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr 2011; 42: 67-78., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20110401]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203425, title=null, value=Little is known about the effectiveness of caregiver management strategies on the functioning of the demented patient. However, identification of specific caregiver strategies may provide useful information on the management and manifestation of behavioural problems in dementia.In the MAAstricht Study of BEhaviour in Dementia (MAASBED) ninety-nine patients with dementia and their informal caregivers were followed up for one year. Interviews were used to assess differences in caregiver management strategies. Behavioural disturbances in the patient were measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Repeated measures analysis was carried out to investigate the relationship between caregiver management strategies and patient behaviour.Results showed that three caregiver management strategies were identified, based on whether caregivers accepted, or not, the caregiving situation and dementia related problems. Caregivers characterized by non-acceptance were typified as 'Nonadapters'; caregivers characterized by acceptance were further subdivided into two groups typified as 'Nurturers' and 'Supporters'. Caregiver characteristics such as sex, education and personality were important determinants of management strategies. Furthermore, non-adapters reported significantly more hyperactivity symptoms in patients and felt less competent than did supporters. Supporters felt most competent and reported the least hyperactivity symptoms in the patient.In conclusion, caregiver management strategies appear to be associated with behavioural problems in dementia and feelings of caregiver competence. Intervention programmes, aimed at teaching caregivers adequate management strategies, may reduce problem behaviours in the patient en caregiver burden., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050201]

In 1993 about 20% of the population in the 15 'old' member countries of the European Union (EU) was over 60 years of age and this percentage will increase to more than 25% in 2020. These developments play a key role for the investments in education and training to meet societies needs for health care services.In 2002 about 25% of the medical students in the 'old' EU did not receive any education in geriatric medicine. A question is who will provide the services for older people in related areas, like social care, community care, acute care in the hospitals, long-term care, permanent care and care for psychiatric patients?Geriatric medicine has been recognized as an independent specialty in 8 of the 15 member countries of the 'old' EU. In all EU member states the governments are autonomous regarding all aspects of health care services, including the recognition of specialties and specialist training programmes. A two years training in internal medicine has been recommended in the EU, followed by another four years of training in geriatric medicine. The specialist training has a hospital oriented character, however, it includes also community care and other institutionalised care like nursing homes. The curriculum should contain: biological, social, psychological and medical aspects of common diseases and disturbances in older people.A problem in many EU countries is the shortage of well trained researchers and leading persons for academic positions for geriatric medicine. In a number of countries chairs at the universities remain vacant for long periods of time or even disappear.

The analyses reveal the great importance of good health. Respondents with a good physical and mental condition, who have a great deal of functional mobility and independence, do feel much better. Secondly, findings indicate that respondents who faced the loss of their partner, experience lower well-being. This explains the found gender differences. Women have lower perceived quality of life, mainly because of their greater susceptibility to widowhood. Furthermore, missing the former job and work role also contributes to lower levels of well-being.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203462, title=null, value=Background: A previous study in Amsterdam showed that combined family support in the Meeting Centres Support Programme, in which persons with dementia patients and their carers are both supported by one professional staff, is more effective in influencing behaviour problems and mood of dementia patients living in the community than non-integrated support, such as day care only. A multi-centre implementation study tests if similar effects are achieved in other regions of The Netherlands.Methods: A pretest-posttest control group design was applied. 112 dementia patients who visited psychogeriatric day care in eight community centres across the country and in three nursing homes, and their carers participated in the study. The patients in the experimental group (n=89) received support from the Meeting Centres Support Programme together with their carers, while the control group (n=23) received day care only. Behaviour problems (aggressive behaviour, inactivity, non-social behaviour) and mood (dissatisfaction, depressive behaviour) were assessed using standardized observation scales. Quality of life was assessed by interviewing the patients.Results: After 7 months the Meeting Centres Support Programme, compared to regular day care, showed a moderately positive effect on the degree of total behaviour problems (effect size=0.52), especially on inactivity (effect size=0.37) and non-social behaviour (effect size=0.60), a large effect on depressive behaviour (effect size=0.92) and a moderate effect on self-esteem (effect size=0.43).Conclusions: The Meeting Centres Support Programme proves to be more effective than regular day care in influencing behaviour problems, especially inactivity and non-social behaviour, and depressed mood. Participation in the programme also seems to have a positive effect on self-esteem, an important aspect of quality of life. These findings surpass the results of the Amsterdam study and confirm the surplus value of the Meeting Centres Support Programme as compared to regular day care for people with mild to severe dementia., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050401]

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and the characteristics of patients in the final phase of dementia in a group of 210 Dutch nursing home patients with dementia. Stage 7 of the Global Deterioration Scale of Reisberg et al. was used to operationally define the final phase of dementia. All patients were scored on a self-constructed assessment scale.

Due to the atypical presentation of the thyroid disease their complaints were attributed to other conditions. In both patients there was a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism.In elder patiens signs and symptoms of thyreotoxicosis are frequently related to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric disorders. Most often occur atrial fibrillation, worsening of cardiac failure and angina pectoris, weight loss, anorexia, constipation, cognitive impairment and delirium.Delay of diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism may be potentially harmful to the patient. Untreated thyreotoxicosis may lead to serious cardiovasculair complications (particularly cardiac failure and cerebrovascular accidents), mental deterioration and osteoporosis.In elder people with unexplained and vague signs and symptoms thyroid function should always be checked. The TSH assay is a very accurate diagnostic test for screening thyroid function. A normal TSH indicates euthyroidism with an accuracy of almost 100%.The medical treatment for hyperthyreoidism in the elderly are antithyroid drugs. When an euthyroid state is rendered, suppletion with L-thyroxine may be nessecary. Radioactive iodine treatment is preferred in some cases though there may be practical difficulties with the application of this treatment in nursing home patients because temporary isolation is necessary., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050401]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203488, title=null, value=Social comparison is increasingly recognized as an important cognitive process in adaptation to old age. By comparing themselves with age peers who are doing worse, i.e., downward comparison, older persons can make an adjusted assessment that allows them to reinterpret their present lives in a positive manner. "Even though I can no longer do my own shopping, I'm still fortunate compared to those who can not leave their houses at all". In this way, older persons may preserve a certain level of life satisfaction, despite age-related loss. In a study among 455 community-dwelling older persons, the effects of social comparison on life satisfaction were examined. Older persons were confronted with a fictitious interview with either an upward or a downward target. After downward comparison, older persons felt more satisfied with their lives than after upward comparison, especially those who had higher levels of frailty. These effects were only found with lower levels of identification. With higher levels of identification, older persons felt more satisfied with their lives after upward comparison than after downward comparison. Apparently, downward comparison only serves its self-enhancing function on life satisfaction among frail elderly persons when they perceive the comparison target as different from themselves., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050601]

This study is based on the outcomes of the program "Privacy in nursing homes" that has been initiated by the Dutch department of health in the late 90's. In this study, personnel of 74 nursing homes were asked to reflect on the way they treat residents. The attitudes of personnel were measured with a questionnaire that contains 80 propositions about their behaviour towards residents. The propositions can be reduced to five factors: kindness, structural environment, control, freedom to choose, and respect. First, we give the general results on these five factors. After that we give insight in the correlations between the five different aspects of treatment and the results of regression analysis.The general conclusion is that the behaviour towards residents in nursing homes at the beginning of the 21(st) Century is far from optimal. Residents most notably lack personal freedom and control over their received care and their way of living. This result is especially worrying because client conformed care has been an important point of attention for some time now. Another important conclusion is that the care for residents has a positive relation with the mangement policy of an organization and so, it is possible to improve the care., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203490, title=null, value=Chronic pain in dementia and in disorders with a high risk for cognitive impairment. Ageing increases the risk for the etiology of chronic pain ánd dementia. Hence, the increase in the number of elderly people implies that the number of elderly with dementia suffering from chronic pain will increase as well. A key question relates to if and how patients with dementia perceive pain. The inadequateness of pain assessment, particularly in a more advanced stage, is also reflected in a decreased use of analgesics by elderly people with dementia. Insight into possible changes in pain experience as have been observed in the few available clinical studies, could be enhanced by knowledge about the neuropathology which may differ per subtype of dementia. It is striking that pain has not been examined in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system with a high risk for cognitive impairment such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. In these disorders, pain is a prominent clinical symptom and to date it is not known whether the experience of pain will change in a stage in which patients become cognitively impaired. Finally, a number of instruments which are most appropriate to assess pain in communicative and non-communicative patients are discussed., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050601]

Dementia affects 195.000 patients of 65 years and older in The Netherlands currently. Rivastigmine and galantamine, both cholinesterase inhibitors, and memantine, an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonist, are licensed for the treatment of AD. In clinical practice, these drugs have limited effects on cognitive and other symptoms of dementia. We describe the practical care of some patients treated with these drugs and discuss the pros and cons of pharmacotherapy in AD. Extensive knowledge of the drugs, other treatment options and of dementia are necessary for good clinical practice in the treatment of these patients and the counselling of their caregivers., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203515, title=null, value=Fear of falling in a fall clinic for geriatric patients: a pilot study               Objective. In this pilot study we wantto determine how often fear of falling occurs in geriatric patients visiting a fall clinic and to study the characteristics of fear of falling and its consequences.Design. Retrospective study of patient's records.Method. A random sample of 100 medical records of geriatric patients of the fall clinic of the Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis in Den Bosch was systematical examined.Results. The mean age of the patients was 79.8 ± 6 years. Before visiting the fall clinic, the patients had a history of falling during 34.6 months, and 62% of them visited a hospital due to the consequences of falling. In the fall clinic a mean number of 2.5 probable causes per fall was diagnosed.In this study 31% of the patients had fear of falling. The demographic characteristics and the causes of falling of the patients with or without fear of falling, were almost the same. Patients with fear of falling had a hip prothesis in 26%, whereas patients without fear of falling only in 7% had a hip prothesis (P<0.05). In patients with fear of falling, in 90% extra diagnostic investigation was needed, whereas in patients without fear of falling extra diagnostic investigation only occurred in 53% (P<0.01). Finally, patients with fear of falling needed 1.8 more times physical therapy compared to patients without fear of falling (P<0.01).Conclusion. After a fall, fear of falling occurs often in geriatric patients. In this study, no causes for fear of falling could be determinated, although hip prothesis are associated with fear of falling. In patients with fear of falling more medical consumption occurs. In medical practice as in science fear of falling needs more attention., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050801]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203516, title=null, value=Is the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale suitable for Dutch older persons living in the community?               Background: In ageing populations fear of falling is an important issue. International studies and collaborations require scales suitable to more cultures. Scales developed in one culture require adaptation and additional investigation of psychometric properties for use in other countries.Objective: To investigate the psychometric properties of a Dutch version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC-NL) and whether adding questions about complex/dual tasks improves the discriminatory power.Method: Subjects were 106 men and 140 women aged 65-92 years. Measures were the 16-item ABC-NL and seven additional more complex items, fall history, general and physical self-efficacy, a functional reach test and a balance platform test.Results: The ABC-NL had a weak ceiling effect. Internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha) was high. The relationship between ABC-NL and physical self-efficacy was significantly stronger than between the ABC-NL and general self-efficacy. Relationships with performance-based measures of balance were moderate. Differences between fallers and non-fallers and between activity avoiders and non-avoiders were significant. Adding questions about complex tasks hardly improved discriminatory power, reliability and validity.Conclusion: Psychometric properties of the ABC-NL were satisfactory. Further research is needed for use in high-functioning older persons., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050801]

Fall-related research data indicate positive effects of a multifactorial intervention targeted on prevention of falls and fall-related injuries.In November 2004 the guideline "Prevention of fall incidents in the elderly" developed by The Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) was published. This guideline pays attention to the risk factors for falling and the prevention of fall incidents in all settings. The highlights for nursing homes are: 1.all nursing home patients are at risk;2.perform a fall risk assessment to direct fall preventive activities;3.together with specific fall prevention for the patient general fall prevention for the institute has to be undertaken;4.a multifactorial approach is indicated. In nursing homes it is possible to perform such approach multidisciplinary., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050801]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203518, title=null, value=Prevention of falls in the elderly - a key role for the falls clinic. Falls are a major health problem among elderly people, because of the incidence and because of the consequences. Current practice commonly focuses on the injury with little attention of the underlying cause, the risk factors for a new fall and the possibilities for future prevention. Most of the falls are a result of multiple risk factors. Several of this risk factors are potentially modifiable. The Dutch Falls Prevention Collaboration have made a protocol to assist health care professionals at a standardised and evidence based way with their assessment of fall risk. With the risk factors identified in the assessment it is possible to make an individual multifactorial fall prevention program. Such an intervention can give a significant reduction of falls in the elderly. The protocol is presented in this article ., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050801]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203519, title=null, value=A fall-clinic forms part of the fall-prevention program in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. In this paper it is explained how elderly who are prone to falling are examined in the fall-clinic to find the underlying cause of their fall problem. The complete examination is termed the fall-risk analysis (FRA). In a six year period 121 elderly visited the fall-clinic. On average they were 78 ± 8 years of age (mean ± standarddeviation) and 76% was female. An insufficient muscle force of the hip flexors was the most prominent limitation that could be related to the increased fall risk. Based on the FRA on average 4.3 ± 1.7 actions were proposed, where a referral to a specialist or physical therapist was most frequently proposed. The fall-clinic is integrated into existing structures of the Dutch health care services. Additional attention is given to case finding by means of district-nurses and family physicians. In this way a highly qualitative health care chain is being created for the falling elderly., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050801]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203520, title=null, value=A Primary Care Program in old age psychiatry: Background, implementation and first experiences. Since 1999, the GP has been assigned the role of the "gatekeeper of mental health care". The aim of which is to treat as many mental problems as possible in primary health care. The generally complicated mental health problems in the elderly confront the GP with difficult diagnostic, treatment, and referral issues. Psychological problems are often masked by somatic complaints and rarely lead to referrals or adequate treatment. Many GPs use support programmes from second-line mental health care, yet nearly all these programs are executed by mental health care units for adults. In mid-western Utrecht, GPs have indicated a distinctive requirement for a support programme specifically aimed at elderly people with mental problems. The specific characteristics of elderly people, who are likely to develop somatic and psychiatric co-morbidity, and cognitive deterioration, require tailored support in primary care. The first results of a support programme for the elderly in primary care are encouraging. Further research will show whether the EPO has sufficient added value for both the GP and the patient to justify large-scale introduction., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20050801]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203552, title=null, value=Pre-morbid personality and aggressive behaviour in psychogeriatic inpatients               In the present study, the correlation was examined between pre-morbid personality traits and the occurrence of aggressive behaviour in residents of a psychogeriatric nursing home. The participants in the study were the close relatives of 39 residents of a psychogeriatric nursing home. These residents were selected on the basis of two subscales of the BOP assessment scale for elderly patients: Aggressive and annoying behaviour, and Mental disability. Residents were divided into two groups: one group did not display aggressive behaviour, the other group displayed a great deal of such behaviour. The groups were comparable with regard to the degree of mental disability. To ascertain pre-morbid personality traits, use was made of the hetero-anamnestic personality questionnaire (HAP) and the Quick Big Five (QBF). We found no significant differences in any of the pre-morbid personality traits between the two groups. We could not confirm the conclusion of other authors that emotional lability (neuroticism) is a personality trait which makes people susceptible to developing aggressive behaviour. In conclusion, our study did not confirm the hypothesis that pre-morbid personality traits are useful to explain the occurrence of aggressive behaviour in residents of a psychogeriatric nursing home., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20051001]

Although many have mental health problems, the mental health services have difficulties in reaching them. This study reports on the experience of mental health problems of elderly Moroccan migrants, their search for help and their view on the role of the mental health services. Twenty-two Moroccan elderly (11 men, 11 women) aged 55-75 were interviewed with a semi-structured questionnaire. From the interviews and observations it appeared that these elderly experience their health as bad. When asked, they deny mental health problems. Stress and dejection are not experienced as relating to mental health but as part of life associated with ageing, living in a foreign country, having physical, social and financial problems. The elderly feel that God sets them these tasks to overcome by themselves. Achieving rest in one's soul is central in this process. There is a taboo on serious mental health problems and people are ashamed of them. Only people who neglect religious prescriptions can to be affected by mental health problems. The elderly Moroccans hardly consult mental health services for these problems because then it would become clear that they cannot overcome their problems by themselves. Furthermore, the mental health services are unknown. Therefore, those services have to pay attention to the specific experience of mental complaints of elderly Moroccans. By offering psycho-education the mental health services may come within reach of those elderly., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20051001]

The vaccination coverage for tetanus , influenza and pneumococcal infections is merely 40, 60 and 30 %, respectively. Besides a reduction in mortality (67 %) and a reduction of hospitalisation for pneumonia and influenza (50 %), vaccination against influenza also results in a decrease in cardio- and cerebrovascular morbidity (20%) as well as in a decrease in the frequency of doctor visits for respiratory infections for COPD patients. Vaccination of children and health care personnel can further reduce transmission of influenza and subsequent influenza related complications in the elderly. Pneumococcal invasive disease can be reduced by 50 % through vaccination. Vaccination of children with the conjugate vaccine can further reduce the incidence of pneumococcal invasive disease in the elderly. Further improvements in vaccine coverage levels are needed, mainly among elderly persons, children and persons at increased risk., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20051001]

Deze richtlijnen zijn gebaseerd op de balans tussen de effectiviteit op langere termijn en de bijwerkingen (verslaving, anterograde amnesie en verhoogd risico op (onge)vallen en mortaliteit). De verslavende eigenschappen van benzodiazepinen blijken ook op te treden bij gebruik van laag-therapeutische doseringen. Hoewel aanvankelijk de aandacht uitging naar het optreden van ontwenningsverschijnselen bij staken, is de laatste decennia meer en meer aandacht gekomen voor de psychologische aspecten van deze verslaving. Recentelijk werd in dierexperimenteel onderzoek het effect van benzodiazepinegebruik op het beloningssysteem in de hersenen aangetoond. Wanneer langdurig benzodiazepinegebruik als probleem wordt onderkend door arts en patiënt blijken verschillende behandelmodaliteiten effectief. Eén op de vier langdurig gebruikers kan op eigen kracht stoppen na goede psycho-educatie en aanmoediging. Twee op de drie kunnen stoppen met behulp van systematische dosisreductie onder begeleiding van een arts of psycholoog. In geval van een onderliggende slaap- of angststoornis, verdient het aanbeveling deze laatste behandeling aan te vullen met cognitieve gedragstherapie. In tegenstelling tot wat vaak gedacht wordt, blijken ook de oudste ouderen goed te kunnen profiteren van deze behandelingen., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20120601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203586, title=null, value=TRENDS IN THE UTILIZATION OF DUTCH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BY OLDER ADULTS BETWEEN 1990-2004: AimBecause the Dutch population has a growing number of older people, an increasing burden on mental health services is expected. To facilitate policy making for the future, it is important to know what changes there have been in use of mental health services by elderly in the past. This study investigates changes in the use of mental health services by older adults in the period 1990-2004. Methods: Information about the use of mental health services by older adults was retrieved from the Dutch Psychiatric Case Registers. Population size in these register areas and the unit costs of the different mental health services were taken into account. Results: In total there was an increase in the number of older adults that used mental health services in the period mentioned above. The costs, however, showed a decrease, which was caused by the decrease of expensive inpatient care and the increase of less expensive outpatient care. This was mainly the case until 2002. From this year on the ratio between inpatient and outpatient care stabilized. Conclusion: Deinstitutionalization of mental health care for older adults was shown in the period 1990-2002. This means that expensive inpatient care is partly replaced by less expensive outpatient care. As a consequence more older adults can be treated with no rise in costs. Since 2002 deinstitutionalization came to a halt. Because a growing number of older adults will be using mental health services in the future, new forms of outpatient care should be explored., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20090401]

Animal naming, profession naming, and the summed score (animal + profession naming) were shown to be profoundly affected by demographical variables, especially age and educational level. The clinical utility of the newly established regression-based VFT norms was evaluated in a large sample of psychogeriatric patients (N=1,063, of which n=890 met the criteria for Alzheimer's or vascular dementia). Results showed that the animal naming VFT score was the most sensitive measure to distinguish normal aging from dementia (when the specificities of the various VFT measures were equated). Fifty patients were found to commit stuck-in-set perseverations, i.e. they generated animal names during test administration of the profession naming VFT. The prevalence of stuck-in-set perseveration was 11.3% in Parkinson dementia and frontal variant frontotemporal dementia, versus 4.6% and 5.3% in dementia of the Alzheimer type and vascular dementia, respectively. Bivariate analyses revealed that people who committed stuck-in-set perseverations were more deficient on a measure of free recall and on several tests of executive control, such as the Expanded Mental Control Test, the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale and the Alternating Graphical Sequences Test as a measure of response inhibition. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the Alternating Graphical Sequences Test retained an independent effect in the association with stuck-in-set perseveration., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20090401]

Methods Patients who were present at the geriatric ward were eligible for a review of their medication and medical problems using a screening form. Recommendations and questions following these forms were subsequently discussed in the gerontopharmacologic meeting ('GFO') held every two weeks. Results In a 30 month-period 44 GFO's were held during which 184 patients were discussed. A total of 206 recommendations were made and 115 questions were asked. Of the recommended interventions,134 (65%) were accepted by the geriatrician. To stop a medication (64/206), to change the dosage of a medication (60/206) and to switch to another medication (44/206) were the types of interventions most accounted for. Conclusion Structured medication review led to a substantial number of medication changes in geriatric inpatients. Nearly two-thirds of the recommended interventions were accepted by the geriatricians. Seventy-two recommendations (35%) were not implemented due to logistic or patient-related reasons., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20090401]

Is this behaviour so "ordinary" as seem to affirm the usual prejudices? In the present article, the authors present an overview of their work on this question. They developed a 10-item 5-point Likert Scale of Preference in Routine. The scale has been validated and related to age, anxiety and depression as well as cognitive deterioration. The results confirm that the routinization can be an interesting indication of vulnerability that must be taken in consideration especially in dealing with institutionalized elderly., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20120901]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23203675, title=null, value=POSITIVE EXPERIENCE THROUGH INFORMAL CARE: CONSTRUCTION OF A SCALE: An 8-item scale has been developed to measure positive experiences by informal caregivers, the Positive Experiences Scale (PES). The PES is a unidimensional hierarchical Mokkenscale which varies from intrinsic satisfaction and relational enhancement to improvement of competence and social enhancement. The scale has a satisfactory Loevinger's H-value (0.37) and reliability (0.74). Furthermore, satisfying H-values are found for large groups of informal caregivers, such as carers for the elderly, the chronically ill, partners, parents and people who live in a care facility. For informal caregivers of people with dementia or mental impairments, two items do not uphold ('I received appreciation for the care I've been giving' and 'the help brought me and my family and friends closer together'. For these groups a 6-item scale is advised. Solely for informal caregivers of people with psychological impairments, the scale as a whole does not uphold. Further research will have to determine how these caregivers derive positive experiences from caregiving. The PES is recommended because of its psychometric qualities and its usefulness in different populations of informal caregivers., journalTitle=Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie, date=20121001]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=23509412, title=null, value=This article focuses on the decision-making processes surrounding the implementation of Bill 25, Quebec's Act Respecting Local Health and Social Services Network Development Agencies. Our intention is to shed light on the strategies of the various groups or institutions that expressed their preferences and attempted, with varying degrees of success, to influence decisions with respect to this major reform of the Quebec health system structure. On a theoretical level, we are relying mostly on the models for analysing the lobbying process, which, since the seminal work of Milbrath (1960, 1963), have essentially presented this practice as a process for exchanging information. Based on the information gathered in the re-transcribed interviews, the strategies observed are actually in line with the constitutive characteristics of lobbying and, in some situations, those of patronage. Ultimately, the combination of these various elements makes it obvious that the implementation of Bill 25 was, first and foremost, a clearly political process. The technical arguments on which the initial objectives of the act were centred have thereby been relegated to the backstage., journalTitle=Canadian public administration : Administration publique du Canada, date=20080101]
