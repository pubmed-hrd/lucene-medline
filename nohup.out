The sensitivity of &sup201;Tl for malignant tumors was 100%(22/22), but specificity was 0%(0/2). On &sup99m;Tc-MIBI scintigraphy, the sensitivity for malignant tumors was 83.3%(10/12) and specificity was 100%(3/3). &sup99m;Tc-MIBI might be more useful for the diagnosis of breast tumors, because the tumor/background ratio of &sup99m;Tc-MIBI was significantly higher than that of &sup201;Tl. In addition, &sup201;Tl scintigraphy and &sup99m;Tc-MIBI scintigrtaphy showed the same degree of accuracy (93.3%) in detecting lymph node metastasis. Moreover, when either ultrasonography (US) with &sup201;Tl or &sup99m;Tc-MIBI scintigraphy was positive for lymph node metastasis, the accuracy of detection became 94.4% The combined use of ultrasonography and scintigraphy might improve the accuracy of diagnosis of lymph node metastasis., journalTitle=Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan), date=19971225]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11441251, title=null, value=The major challenges in clinical oncological drug studies are to detect promising drug candidates early on in clinical drug development and to protect patients from adverse drug reactions of ineffective drugs. These challenges are met in the classical concept of clinical oncological drug trials in three phases. The aim of the present article is to provide a concise and comprehensive overview of the scientific logic of these 3 phases. Recent progress in the conception of clinical oncological drug studies was made in particular in phase I where the implementation of novel dose escalation procedures has led to a speeding up of phase I and an increase in the number of patients that receive an experimental drug in the therapeutic concentration range. However, the classical 3-phase concept of clinical oncological drug trials can not be transposed to trials with some novel anticancer drugs without critical reappraisal. It is therefore expected that this classical concept will undergo specific modifications in the near future. Copyright 2000 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg, journalTitle=Onkologie, date=20001001]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11441254, title=null, value=The last years were characterized by efforts on the field of urological oncology: development of highly effective regimens for the curative treatment of metastatic diseases, improvement of diagnostic techniques based on monoclonal antibodies and molecularbiological techniques, development of operative techniques to improve quality of life in tumor patients. The cisplatin-based chemotherapy led to a dramatic improvement in patients with even extended testicular cancer disease and reflect one of the major highlights in urological oncology in the last century. Based on monoclonal antibodies and molecular techniques, diagnostic approach changed for prostatic carcinoma by using prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and for testicular cancer by determining alfa fetoprotein (AFP) and beta human choreongonadotropin (beta-HCG). These marker systems are of importance for treatment decision and follow up. Other efforts were revealed in the development of operative techniques with an improvement of quality of life (urinary bladder substitution, potency sparing operative techniques) and the possibility of organ preserving treatment in renal cell carcinoma.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945280, title=null, value=The influence of the esterification of the 3'(2') hydroxyl group of tRNA on the hydrolysis by venom phosphodiesterase (Crotalus adamanteus) was studied. It was shown that this esterification does not change the rate of hydrolysis. At pH 7-8, no significant differences were observed either when the alpha amino group of the attached amino acid was free or blocked, or when the aminoacid contained a free carboxyl group or a second amino group (glutamic acid or lysine).

A zinc content of 5.0 - 7.6 g-atoms of Zn/M.W. 3.2 x 10(6) was estimated by labelling with 65Zn and by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. By continuous dialysis against o-phenanthroline zinc was almost completely removed. The enzymatically inactive "apo"-enzyme could not be reactivated by addition of Zn(2+).

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945362, title=null, value=5'-Methylammonium-5'-deoxyadenosine is a poor subsrate for adenosine desaminase. The nucleoside was crystallized from aqueous methanol as its iodide monohydrate in space group P2(1). The structure was solved from three dimensional X-ray data and refined to R = 4.1%. The structure of the nucleoside is determined by an intramolecular hydrogen bond from N5' to N3 which implies that (1) the edenine heterocycle is in syn position with respect to the sugar moiety; (2) the ribose pucker is C2'-exo, C3'-endo and (3) the conformation about the C4'-C5' bond is trans, gauche. The water of hydration is fourfold disordered and forms a linear hydrophilic region which is surrounded by nucleoside molecules in a zigzag arrangement. The adenine heterocycles are not stacked and in closer than Van der Waals distance with iodine ions suggesting a charge transfer type interaction., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700924]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945480, title=null, value=The contents of sterol derivatives (sterols + esters, glycosides and acylated glycosides) have been determined using thin layer chromatography in leaves and bulky and organs from carrots (Daucus carota L.) potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), onion (Allium cepa L.) two varieties of radish (Raphanus sativus L.) and Gentiana purpurea L. plants. Ether-soluble lipids of leaves contain 2.8-5.2%, those of storage tissue 3.1-8.9% sterol derivatives.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945497, title=null, value=Several authors have described the NBD-chloride (7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) as a fluorogenic reagent of the amino groups and the sulfhydryl groups. It reacts rapidly with the trypsin to produce a stable and highly fluorescent conjugate. The determination of the labelled residues was made with thin layer chromatographies; the lysin residues were preferentially labelled.Fluorescence depolarization measurements of the conjugate were used to determine the brownian relaxation of the enzyme. The temperature dependence of the life-time is very strong and the corrected Perrin's plot demonstrates that the relaxation time of the enzyme decreases rapidly with the temperature.The conclusion is that the NBD-chloride can be used, like the DNS-chloride but is more reactive and stable and its fixation, on trypsin can be followed by measuring the absorbance of the dye at 470 nm., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19701211]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945498, title=null, value=Tryptic hydrolysis of different arginine nitroanilides was studied. Para-nitroanilide is the most readily hydrolyzed substrate, ortho derivative is 5 times less sensitive and meta derivative is a very weak substrate. When the benzoyl group bound on the N(alpha) arginine of BAPNA is replaced by a carbobenzoxy group (L-ZAPNA), the tryptic hydrolysis is increased by a factor of 3. With this latter substrate, the kinetic constants are determined for two forms, native and Nepsilon-acetylated of porcine and bovine trypsin. Evidence is presented that the rate of hydrolysis is both related to the global and local charges of the enzyme., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19701211]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11945541, title=null, value=Presqualenyl-pyrophosphate (PSPP) was synthesized from farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP). The purified product could be transformed into a squalene in 90% yield. The structure of PSPP was established by the following experiments:1) PSPP displays a remarkably acid-labile phosphate-ester bond. Analogous to FPP it was possible to stabilize this bond by the addition of bromine. This indicates a structure of the allylester type.2) On acid hydrolysis PSPP splits off not only the pyrophosphate but also water. This may be best explained by the presence of a tertiary hydroxyl group in PSPP.3) The pyrophosphate group of PSPP could be split by prostatic phosphatase. In gas-liquid-chromatography the trimethyl-silylated product gave a single peak. From the mass spectra of this compound and of the corresponding alcohol the expected molecular weight of 426 could be verified for the latter.4) Determining the 3H/(14)C ratio in 1-(3)H(2)-4(14)C-FPP and in PSPP and squalene, synthesized from it, only three 3H-atoms could be detected in PSPP and in squalene.5) Ozonisation of PSPP, synthesized from 1-(14)C-FPP, gave radioactive malondialdehyde, which was characterised as azobenzene-malondialdehyde and 4-azobenzene-1-phenyl-pyrazole. The experimental results are in agreement with the following structure of 2, 6, 10, 15, 19, 23-hexamethyl-n-tetracosa-2, 6, 11, 14, 18, 22-hexaen-10-yl-pyrophosphate for PSPP., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19701223]

After the acetate administration the radioactivity of palmitic and stearic acids and that of their carboxyl carbons was also measured. The repartition of the radioactivity was discussed in relation with the localization of fatty acid synthesis.

We used the formation of these complexes for the detection of the isoenzyme bands of carbonic anhydrase in isoelectric focusing and electrophoresis in acrylamide gels. DNSA is added to the solution of the isoenzymes before separation. Using quartz tubes - the maximum of the excitation spectrum is 280 nm [1] - for supporting the gels the fluorescent enzyme bands can be observed during development in UV light and without putting the gels out of the quartz tubes. This technique allows the detection of the carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes with greater precision and simplicity than with any staining method., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19710901]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11946256, title=null, value=The blockage of the carboxyl groups of a pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (inhibitor of Kunitz) has been performed with a water-soluble carbodiimide and glycine ethyl ester. The inhibitor has five carboxyl groups located on residues Asp(3), Glu(7), Glu(49), Asp(50) and Ala(58). When the reaction is carried out on native inhibitor or on inhibitor treated with 8 M urea, approximately 3 moles of glycine ethyl ester are introduced but 4, 3 residues can be incorporated into performic acid oxidized inhibitor. Fully active derivatives with a complete substitution of the C-terminal residue can be obtained.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11946428, title=null, value=Fatty acids of acyl steryl glycoside (acyl SG) of different plants producing both green and photosynthetically inactive tissue have been analyzed. The major components are in all cases 16:0, 18:2 and 18:3 acids. The fatty acid composition of acyl SG of green parts is very similar to that of etiolated, pale or storage tissue of the same plant. Generally the degree of saturation of acyl SG is higher than that of the corresponding total lipid. Acyl SG tends to be more saturated in green parts than in colorless tissues of the same plant. Conversely, total lipid of green tissue containing large amounts of galactolipids and 18:3 acid is much less saturated than that of photosynthetically inactive tissue. Though containing smaller amounts of 18:3, and in some cases unsaturated C(16) acids, acyl SG does not reflect the drastic increase of these acids in the total lipid of green tissue. It is concluded that fatty acids of acyl SG originate mainly from an acyl donor other than chloroplast galactolipids., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19720201]

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11946635, title=null, value=The high molecular weight arylamidase-alkaline phosphatase-complex from rat kidney microsomes [1] was carefully dissociated by means of treatment with several hydrolytic enzymes or by acidification. Trypsin, chymotrypsin and pronase cause a selective solubilization of the enzymes discernible at their different electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gel. The lower migrating zone represents phosphatase, the faster migrating zone shows arylamidase activity (molecular weights 180,000 and 172,000, respectively). Incubation of the complex with papain, lipase, neuraminidase or hyaluronidase and incubation at acid conditions (pH optimum 5.0) in the absence of any enzyme also yields in the appearance of two protein bands. In contrast to the alkaline hydrolases the acid hydrolases, the pH 5-treatment and with a certain degree also the lipase liberate a second arylamidase zone lying in the phosphatese containing zone during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Treatment with SDS and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis also results in a dissociation of the complex, but only in one protein fragement (approx, molecular weight 205,000)., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19720515]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11946669, title=null, value=1. The energy-independent exchange of alkali metal cations against protons was investigated in intact and disintegrated mitochondria. The exchange is not specific for different alkali metal ions.2.

At all ions studied the maximum release of protons was 15-20 nval/mg protein.3. In disintegrated mitochondria there are no differences between the alkali metal ions (apparent K(m) 30 mM; maximum H(+)-release 50 nval/mg protein).4.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947041, title=null, value=The interaction of Actinomycin C(1) (AM) with purine nucleosides was investigated by circular dichroism. While dG and dGMP show identical interactions, rG, rGMP and 8-aza-GMP show lower tendency for complex formation. ara-G shows no complex formation. 6-Thio-GMP shows the strongest affinity for AM in accordance with previous results. Substitution on N-7 (methylation, protonation) or C-8 (8-Br-rG, 8-SH-rG) eliminate completely the complexing capacity. Another type of weaker complexes is formed by dA, dAMP and rIMP, indicated by the appearance of a positive band at 440 nm. It is concluded that in these complexes both the electron donor capacity of the purine base as well as the steric flexibility of the sugar around the glycosidic linkage determine their complexing capacity., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19690601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947135, title=null, value=The complex formed between trypsin and alpha(2)-macroglobulin retains the whole hydrolytic activity for benzoylarginine-p-nitroanilide (DL BAPNA). We have observed that the inhibition of this activity is dependent on the inhibitor used. While soya bean inhibitor (MW = 20 000) is ineffective, the basic pancreatic inhibitor (MW = 6 500) progressively inhibits the complex. In this latter case, we have observed the formation of a very weakly active ternary compound by two methods: kinetic and fluorescence polarization.Such differences suggest either that the contact site of trypsin for binding is not the same for each inhibitor or that the steric hindrance by macroglobulin prevents large inhibitors from reaching the active site. The pancreatic inhibitor can reach this site but its affinity is lower for the complex than for free trypsin., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19690701]

The results show a difference in the specificities of the two extracts. Chromatography on DEAE Sephadex suggests that the tRNA Met is methylated by the enzymes on the myeloma, while enzymes from liver react very little, if at all, with that particular tRNA species.

Plotting the log of molecular weights of several standard proteins against distance of migration or against 3 log of rate of n-dgration reveal linear relationships in ranges of 50.000 - 200.000 or 100.000 - 400.000 Daltons respectively. On this basis, a simple method for molecular weight determination of proteins (accuracy +/- 5 degrees ) has been devised. The method can also be applied for an individual protein in protein mixtures using specific staining procedures., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19691112]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947311, title=null, value=The levels of galactosyl diglycerides and the composition of fatty acids of Spirodela oligorrhiza (Lemnaceae) plants cultivated on a nutrient containing 1% glucose were studied. Controls were grown on a medium without glucose. Between the 10(th) and the 25(th) day of growth the ether-soluble lipids of glucose-stimulated plants contained less monogalactosyl diglyceride (MG) but more digalactosyl diglyceride (DG) than controls. In the same time a marked decrease of the relative amount of C(18:3) acid and an increase of that of C(18:2) and C(16:0) acids was observed. These changes of the lipid composition might be one reason for the structural changes in the chloroplast fine structure of glucose-stimulated Spirodela plants., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19691230]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947316, title=null, value=The synthesis of fatty acids in mitochondria, microsomes and supernatant of rat adipose tissue was studied after administration of U-(14)C(-) glucose. The major site of fatty acids synthesis was the supernatant in controls and the microsomes in insulin-treated animals. The action of insulin cannot be explained only by an increase of the intra-cellular penetration of glucose. An action on enzyme synthesis is probable., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19691230]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947330, title=null, value=Nocardia kirovani cell walls possess a lipidic fraction, a lipolysaccharidic fraction and a peptidoglycan. The lipidic part is composed of glycerides, C(16) and C(18) free fatty acids, nocardic acids and of a carotenoid pigment. The lipopolysaccharidic part is composed of an arabinogalactan esterified by nocardic acids. The glycan strand consists of alternating 1-->4 linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-glycolylmuramic acid residues substituted by a peptide subunit in which the aminoacids Ala, Glu, meso-Dap are present in the molar proportions 1,7:1,2:1., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700115]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947343, title=null, value=The smooth microsomal fractions from Aspergillus oryzae were shown to carry out transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to endogenous proteins acceptors. Data also are presented which support that among the subcellular fractions, only the microsomes are active in the mannose transfer reaction. All of the radioactive material chromatographs with mannose, following acid hydrolysis of microsomal fractions., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700126]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947362, title=null, value=From proinsulin-free insulin we obtained maximal purified insulin by means of preparative polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PADE). This substance appears in the analytical PADE as a uniform band and possesses glycine and phenylalanine as N-terminal amino acids. By use of the eviscerated rabbit as testing model, the product displays a higher hypoglycemic activity as compared with the Toronto standard., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700216]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947365, title=null, value=Bovine liver catalase is separated into several distinct bands by electrophoresis in a linear concentration gradient of polyacrylamide. Apparently, disc electrophoresis under these conditions leads to a series of enzymatic active forms of catalase. Their molecular weights are: 248,000; 295,000; 368,000; 486,000; 705,000 respectively. Density gradient centrifugation separates catalase into two components with molecular weights of 252,000 and 316,000. The observed differences in molecular weight distribution between gel-electrophoresis and density gradient centrifugation are discussed., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700216]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947390, title=null, value=The alkaline phosphatase of beef, horse, pig and sheep brain have been purified. In each case, the alkaline phosphatase activity can be separated into two or three components by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and by electrophoresis. Although the properties of these enzyme fractions are very similar, there are sufficient differences to identify each species.Furthermore two of the three components separated in sheep brain differ in their Michaelis constants using beta-glycerophosphate as substrate, whereas the two pig brain components are not different in this respect. This supports the view of two alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes in sheep brain., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700216]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947407, title=null, value=A method is devised for isolation of pure nucleoli, devoid of perinucleolar chromatin, from rat hepatoma in a medium of high ionic strength (I = 1, MgCl(2) = 0.33 M)., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700225]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947432, title=null, value=Several glycolipid fractions have been isolated from the bound lipids of N. brasiliensis. The main fraction was characterized as a monoester of nocardomycolic acids and D-arabinose. Fractionation of the free lipids yielded a glycolipid fraction consisting of nocardomycouc acids, arabinose, galactose and several amino acids. This last fraction appears to be similar to wax D of Mycobacteria; mild acid treatment of this fraction produced arabinose mononorcardomycolate., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700316]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947437, title=null, value=Spontaneous mutants of the bacteriophage fd and mutants resulting from fd-infected cultures of E. coli grown in the presence of 2.7-diaminofluoren and proflavin were isolated by means of free flow electrophoresis.The amino acid analyses of the mutant coat proteins (B-proteins) show significant differences in comparison with the amino acid analyses of wild type coat protein., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700316]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947462, title=null, value=In alkaline aqueous solution, the sedimentation coefficients of DeoxyHb, HbO(2) and HbCO of Lampetra fluviatilis L. are 1.9 +/- 0.1 S. This value corresponds to a molecular weight of about 17,000, i.e. the value of a single haem polypeptide chain. In weak acidic conditions, both the non-liganded DeoxyHb and the liganded forms, HbO2 and HbCO, associate to form dimers and oligomers. The monomer-oligomer transitions of these compounds take place at different pH values: DeoxyHb pHO.5 approximately 6.7; HbO(2) and HbCO pH(O.5) approximately 5.9. With respect to the association modus, the equilibrium: 4 Hb &rlhar2; 2 Hb(2)&rlhar2;Hb(4) may be preferred., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700402]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947486, title=null, value=In light or dark grown Euglena gracilis cells, the DPG content, in contrast to the PG content, is dependent on the carbon source. These results are closely related to the electron microscopy observations, showing structural changes in mitochondria varying with the carbon source of the media.Two media have been used: the first one contains L-glutamic and DL-malic acid and the second contains DL-lactic acid. The phospholipidic analysis shows that PC and PE are the two main phospholipids., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700416]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947502, title=null, value=An incubation mixture of TDP-D-glucose and a purified enzyme extract from E. coli B containing TDP-D-glucose 4,6-hydro-lyase was treated with NaB(3)H(4). Hydrolysis of the separated sugar nucleotide fraction yielded D-galactose-4-(3)H but no 3H-labelled D-glucose. This indicates the presence of TDP-4-keto-D-glucose as an intermediate in the enzymatic conversion of TDP-D-glucose to TDP-L-rhamnose. The stereospecifity of the NaB(3)H(4) reduction can only be explained if TDP-4-keto-D-glucose exists as an enzyme bound complex., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700501]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947522, title=null, value=Yeast phosphofructokinase exists in several enzymically active, interconvertible forms with molecular weights of 180,000, 370,000, 570,000 and 750,000. With disc-electrophoresis catalytically active aggregation products with molecular weights of more than one million can be detected.In alkaline media fragmentation of phosphofructokinase occurs, leading to a variety of catalytically inactive products. These seem to be oligomers of subunits with 60,000 daltons. A model of the complex subunit structure of yeast phosphofructokinase is suggested. The various catalytically active forms of the enzyme are considered as polymers of 180,000 monomers, which themselves are enzymatically active and which are composed of three 60,000 subunits., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700511]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947549, title=null, value=Kinetic properties of microsomal glucokinase of rat liver have been investigated.

Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947550, title=null, value=The pH dependence of spin-spin coupling constants J (P-O-P) of ADP and ATP has been determined from the phosphorus NMR spectra at 0 degrees. The variation curves have been interpreted as titration curves. These give different pK values. Comparison with the tripolyphosphate shows the existence of triphosphate chain structural deformation in the nucleotides., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947552, title=null, value=Histone is able to associate with radioactive RNA to form a complex which is retained on a millipore filter; 500 &mgr;g of histone F(1) from bone marrow is able to combine with 100 &mgr;g of RNA. Chromatin acidic proteins reduce this association up to 50%. The binding between RNA and histone does not occur in the presence of urea and NaCl., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947558, title=null, value=Guinea-pig antisera to bovine insulin and proinsulin were analysed and the association constants and the concentrations of combining sites specific for insulin and for the C-chain were determined. Both antisera contained combining sites with higher (Ak(1) sites) and lower (Ak(2) sites) affinities for the cross-reacting antigens.Antisera produced in response to both insulin and proinsulin had similar concentrations of both the more affine and less affine insulin-specific binding sites. Bovine insulin contaminated with traces of proinsulin did not induce antibodies specific for the C-chain.Antisera to proinsulin contained equal amounts of high affinity binding sites specific for the C-chain and for the insulin part of the molecule. After absorption of the insulin-specific antibodies these sera can be used for the immunoassay of proinsulin., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700601]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947567, title=null, value=The turnover of terminal AMP of rat liver tRNA relative to that of internal AMP was studied in presence of various inhibitors. Actinomycin D and aflatoxin B(1), which strongly depress transcription in liver, lead to an increase of the specific radioactivity of external AMP/specific radioactivity of internal AMP ratio. On the contrary, drugs which inhibit the in vivo incorporation of aminoacids determine a significant decrease of this ratio., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700608]
Exception: value must not be null, Abstract [pmid=11947573, title=null, value=The energy-independent K(+)-H(+)-exchange was measured in intact mitochondria and submitochondrial particles at different K(+)-concentration of the incubation medium. Correlation was found between H+-displacement and specific activity of monoamine oxidase. It is concluded, that the energy-independent K(+)-H(+)-exchange is localized in the outer membrane of mitochondria., journalTitle=FEBS letters, date=19700608]
